## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### TileLoader Design

**Loading Strategy:**

- Automatic selection between standard and chunked loading
- Based on file size threshold (500MB default)
- Memory-efficient for large datasets

**Data Structure:**

- Returns dictionary with all extracted data
- Consistent structure across loading methods
- Easy to pass between modules

**Preprocessing:**

- Separate methods for each operation
- Can be called independently or together
- Preserves original data if needed

### FeatureComputer Design

**Priority System:**

- Try input LAZ first (fastest, most accurate)
- Fall back to fetching from external sources
- Compute as last resort

**Feature Flow:**

- Clear separation of geometric, RGB, NIR, NDVI
- Debug logging for troubleshooting feature loss
- Integration with existing factory pattern

**Architectural Style:**

- Separate method for flexibility
- Supports both single and multi-label encoding
- Optional based on configuration

- Test validation with edge cases
- Test corruption recovery

**FeatureComputer Tests:**

- Test geometric feature computation (CPU)
- Test geometric feature computation (GPU if available)
- Test RGB extraction from input LAZ
- Test RGB fetching from external source

- Test NDVI computation from RGB+NIR
- Test NDVI extraction from input LAZ
- Test architectural style encoding (single)
- Test architectural style encoding (multi-label)
- Test feature flow logging

**Integration Tests:**
