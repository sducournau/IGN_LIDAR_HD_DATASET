## üîÑ Next Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Release (REQUIRED)

**Option A: Via GitHub Web UI (Recommended)**

1. Go to: https://github.com/sducournau/IGN_LIDAR_HD_DATASET/releases/new?tag=v3.3.3
2. The tag `v3.3.3` should already be selected
3. Set the title: `Release v3.3.3 - Enhanced DTM Integration, Memory Optimization & Code Simplification`
4. Copy the content from `RELEASE_NOTES_v3.3.3.md` into the description
5. Check "Set as the latest release"
6. Click "Publish release"

**Option B: Via GitHub CLI (if installed)**

```bash
gh release create v3.3.3 \
  --title "Release v3.3.3 - Enhanced DTM Integration, Memory Optimization & Code Simplification" \
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES_v3.3.3.md \
  --latest
```

### 2. Upload to PyPI (REQUIRED for pip installation)

**Prerequisites:**

- Ensure you have PyPI credentials configured
- Activate appropriate Python environment (base conda or ign_gpu)

**Upload Command:**

```bash
# Interactive upload script (recommended)
bash scripts/upload_to_pypi.sh
```

**Manual Upload (alternative):**

```bash
# Clean old builds
rm -rf build/ dist/ ign_lidar_hd.egg-info/

# Build package
python -m build

# Validate package
twine check dist/*

# Upload to PyPI (with skip-existing to avoid errors)
twine upload --skip-existing dist/*
```

### 3. Verify Release

After uploading to PyPI, verify the installation:

```bash
# Create test environment
conda create -n test_v3.3.3 python=3.9 -y
conda activate test_v3.3.3

# Install from PyPI
pip install ign-lidar-hd==3.3.3

# Verify version
python -c "import ign_lidar; print(ign_lidar.__version__)"
# Should print: 3.3.3

# Test basic functionality
ign-lidar-hd --help
```

### 4. Announce Release (Optional)

After verifying the release works:

- [ ] Post announcement on project discussions/community channels
- [ ] Update documentation website if needed
