## 🚀 Deployment Commands

### Option 1: Preview Locally (Recommended First)

```bash
cd /mnt/d/Users/Simon/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/IGN_LIDAR_HD_DATASET/website
npm run serve
```

This will serve the built documentation at `http://localhost:3000` for final review.

### Option 2: Deploy to Production

```bash
cd /mnt/d/Users/Simon/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/IGN_LIDAR_HD_DATASET/website
npm run deploy
```

This will deploy the documentation to GitHub Pages.

## ✅ Quality Checks Passed

- ✅ All MDX files compile without errors
- ✅ Version references accurate (v2.0.2)
- ✅ Architecture documentation reflects v2.0 modular design
- ✅ Both CLI systems documented (legacy + Hydra)
- ✅ Migration guide provides clear upgrade path
- ✅ All new v2.0 features documented
- ✅ Build succeeds for both English and French
- ✅ No critical broken links (only minor anchor warnings)

---

## ⚠️ Known Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

These are warnings only and do not prevent deployment:

1. **Broken Anchor Links** (3-4 instances)

   - Some workflow section anchors need adjustment
   - Does not affect core functionality
   - Can be fixed post-deployment

2. **Undefined Blog Tags** (2 instances)

   - Some blog posts use tags not in `tags.yml`
   - Does not affect documentation pages
   - Low priority

3. **Git Tracking Warning**
   - Cannot infer update dates for some files
   - Informational only
   - No impact on build

## 📚 Documentation Files

### Key Files to Keep

- `DOCS_STATUS.md` - Current status tracking
- `DOCUSAURUS_UPDATE_PLAN.md` - Master implementation plan
- `DOCS_DEPLOYMENT_READY.md` - This file (deployment readiness)

### Files to Archive/Remove (Optional Cleanup)

These files served their purpose during the update process and can be archived:

- `DOCS_UPDATE_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.md`
- `DOCS_UPDATE_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`
- `DOCS_UPDATE_FINAL_SUMMARY.md`
- `DOCS_UPDATE_INDEX.md`
- `DOCS_UPDATE_PROGRESS.md`
- `DOCS_UPDATE_QUICK_ACTIONS.md`
- `DOCS_UPDATE_QUICK_START.md`
- `DOCS_UPDATE_ROADMAP.md`
- `DOCS_UPDATE_SESSION_SUMMARY.md`

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### MDX Gotchas

1. **Escape `<` characters**: Use `&lt;` instead of `<` in text (e.g., `&lt;1M` not `<1M`)
2. **Use markdown links**: Convert `<https://...>` to `[URL](URL)` format
3. **Test builds frequently**: Catch syntax errors early

### Documentation Best Practices

1. **Version-agnostic language**: "Introduced in vX.X, available in current version"
2. **Preserve history**: Keep old release notes intact
3. **Comprehensive migration guides**: Essential for major version updates
4. **Dual system documentation**: Support both old and new approaches during transition
