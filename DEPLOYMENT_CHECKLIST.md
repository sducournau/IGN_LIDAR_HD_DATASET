## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Preview Locally (Recommended)

```bash
cd /mnt/d/Users/Simon/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/IGN_LIDAR_HD_DATASET/website
npm run serve
```

**Then open:** `http://localhost:3000`

**What to Check:**

- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Version badge shows v2.0.2
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] All major pages render properly
  - [ ] `/` (intro)
  - [ ] `/architecture`
  - [ ] `/guides/getting-started`
  - [ ] `/guides/hydra-cli`
  - [ ] `/guides/migration-v1-to-v2`
  - [ ] `/api/cli`
  - [ ] `/release-notes/v2.0.2`

### Step 2: Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
cd /mnt/d/Users/Simon/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/IGN_LIDAR_HD_DATASET/website
npm run deploy
```

**What Happens:**

- Builds the documentation
- Pushes to `gh-pages` branch
- GitHub Pages automatically deploys

**Expected Duration:** 2-5 minutes

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

Once deployment completes:

1. **Visit the live site** (wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to update)

   - URL: `https://sducournau.github.io/IGN_LIDAR_HD_DATASET/`

2. **Check key pages:**

   - [ ] Homepage shows v2.0.2
   - [ ] Migration banner visible
   - [ ] Release notes accessible
   - [ ] Search works
   - [ ] Both EN and FR locales work

3. **Test user journeys:**
   - [ ] New user: Can find getting started guide
   - [ ] v1.x user: Can find migration guide
   - [ ] Developer: Can find API documentation
   - [ ] Feature user: Can find feature guides

---

## Post-Deployment Actions

### Immediate (Required)

- [ ] Announce documentation update

  - GitHub Discussions
  - Project README
  - Release notes

- [ ] Update project badges if needed
  - Documentation badge
  - Version badge

### Short-term (Within 1 week)

- [ ] Monitor user feedback
- [ ] Address any reported issues
- [ ] Update FAQ based on questions

### Optional Improvements (Future)

- [ ] Fix non-critical broken anchor links
- [ ] Add more code examples
- [ ] Create additional diagrams
- [ ] Add video tutorials
- [ ] Expand troubleshooting sections

---

## Known Non-Critical Issues

These can be addressed post-deployment:

### 1. Broken Anchor Links (Low Priority)

**French locale workflows page** has some internal anchor links that need adjustment:

- `#-basic-workflow`
- `#-gpu-accelerated-workflow`
- `#-smart-skip-workflow`
- `#-parallel-processing-workflow`
- `#-best-practice-workflows`

**Impact:** Minimal - users can still access content by scrolling

**Fix:** Update anchor syntax in French translation

### 2. Undefined Blog Tags (Very Low Priority)

Some blog posts use tags not defined in `tags.yml`:

- `gpu`, `performance`, `rgb`
- `features`, `orthophotos`, `multi-modal`

**Impact:** None - doesn't affect documentation pages

**Fix:** Add tags to `website/blog/tags.yml`

### 3. Git Tracking Warning (Informational)

Some files show "Cannot infer update date" warning

**Impact:** None - dates still display correctly

**Fix:** Ensure all files are committed to git

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after deployment:

### Quick Rollback

```bash
cd /mnt/d/Users/Simon/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/IGN_LIDAR_HD_DATASET
git checkout gh-pages
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Go back one commit
git push --force origin gh-pages
```

### Alternative: Fix Forward

For minor issues, it's often faster to fix and redeploy:

```bash
# Make fixes to docs
cd website
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
