Centralized Classification Priority System

This module defines the canonical priority order for ground truth features
when multiple features overlap at the same spatial location.

Priority Rule: HIGHER number = HIGHER priority (overwrites lower priority)

Usage:
    from ign_lidar.core.classification.priorities import (
        PRIORITY_ORDER,
        get_priority_value,
        get_label_map

# âœ… CANONICAL PRIORITY ORDER (highest to lowest)
# When a point is in multiple polygons, the feature with the HIGHEST priority
# value wins.
#
# Priority values are assigned in descending order from the list:
# - buildings: priority 9 (highest)
# - bridges: priority 8
# - railways: priority 7
# - sports: priority 6
# - parking: priority 5
# - cemeteries: priority 4
# - water: priority 3
# - vegetation: priority 2
# - roads: priority 1 (lowest)
#
# ðŸ”„ V3.0.6 CHANGE: Roads moved to lowest priority (below vegetation)
# This ensures vegetation can overwrite roads (trees on roads remain as
# vegetation) while roads are processed first in sequential iteration.
