Centralized Classification Priority System

This module defines the canonical priority order for ground truth features
when multiple features overlap at the same spatial location.

Priority Rule: HIGHER number = HIGHER priority (overwrites lower priority)

Usage:
    from ign_lidar.core.classification.priorities import (
        PRIORITY_ORDER,
        get_priority_value,
        get_label_map

# value wins.

# - bridges: priority 8
# - roads: priority 7
# - railways: priority 6
# - sports: priority 5
# - parking: priority 4
