Building Classification Module

This module provides comprehensive building classification functionality including:
- Adaptive building classification with ground truth guidance
- Multi-mode building detection (ASPRS, LOD2, LOD3)
- Building point clustering by footprint
- Multi-source building polygon fusion

The module is organized into:
- base: Abstract base classes and common interfaces
- utils: Shared utility functions
- adaptive: AdaptiveBuildingClassifier
- detection: BuildingDetector
- clustering: BuildingClusterer
- fusion: BuildingFusion

Usage:
    from ign_lidar.core.classification.building import AdaptiveBuildingClassifier

    classifier = AdaptiveBuildingClassifier(mode='asprs')
    result = classifier.classify(points)
