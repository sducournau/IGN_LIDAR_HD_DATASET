Geometric Rules Module for Intelligent Reclassification

This module provides geometric and spectral rules to improve classification accuracy:
1. Road-vegetation overlap detection using vertical separation and NDVI
2. Building buffer zone classification for nearby unclassified points
3. Height-based disambiguation for overlapping features
4. NDVI-based vegetation refinement
