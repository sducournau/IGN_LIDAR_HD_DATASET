# Offline Boundary Processing (No Downloads)
#
# This configuration uses tile stitching but disables auto-download.
# Best for: Offline processing, pre-downloaded datasets, or when network is unavailable

defaults:
  - override /processor: gpu
  - override /features: full
  - override /preprocess: aggressive
  - override /stitching: enhanced # Enhanced stitching WITHOUT auto-download
  - override /output: default
