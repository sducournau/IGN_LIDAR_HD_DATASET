# Offline Boundary Processing (No Downloads)
#
# This configuration uses tile stitching but disables auto-download.
# Best for: Offline processing, pre-downloaded datasets, or when network is unavailable

# @package _global_
defaults:
  - _base/boundary_aware_common # Inherit common boundary-aware settings
  - _self_ # Apply experiment overrides last

experiment_name: "boundary_aware_offline"
experiment_description: "Boundary-aware processing with local tiles only (no downloads)"

# Offline-specific overrides
stitching:
  auto_detect_neighbors: true
  auto_download_neighbors: false # ‚ùå No automatic downloads

  # Use only locally available tiles
  cache_enabled: true
  parallel_loading: true
# Notes:
# - Will use neighbors if already present locally
# - Will not attempt to download missing neighbors
# - Suitable for offline processing
# - Faster startup (no WFS queries)
