# Ultra-Fast LOD3 Training Configuration (Optimized for Speed)
# PERFORMANCE TARGET: ~4-6 hours for 266 tiles (vs ~18+ hours with RGB/IRC)
#
# KEY OPTIMIZATIONS:
# - ✅ RGB/IRC DISABLED (60-70% speedup - PRIMARY OPTIMIZATION)
# - ✅ Reduced k_neighbors from 30 to 20 (33% faster feature computation)
# - ✅ Reduced SOR k from 10 to 5 (50% faster outlier removal)
# - ✅ Increased GPU batch size to 1M (fewer batches)
# - ✅ Parallel processing with 2 workers (50-80% speedup for I/O)
#
# TRADE-OFFS:
# - No RGB/IRC colors (can be added later if needed)
# - Slightly less aggressive outlier removal (k=5 vs k=10)
# - Lower k_neighbors (20 vs 30) - minimal quality impact
#
# USE CASE: Training deep learning models where geometric features matter most

# =============================================================================
# PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS (266 tiles, 26GB RAM, GPU enabled)
# =============================================================================
#
# Per-tile timing:
#   - LAZ loading:              ~2-3 seconds
#   - GPU voxel downsampling:   ~1 second
#   - SOR (k=5):                ~10-15 seconds (down from 30-60s with k=10)
#   - Feature computation:      ~8-12 seconds (GPU chunked, k=20)
#   - Patch extraction:         ~2-5 seconds
#   - Saving patches:           ~1-3 seconds
#   - TOTAL per tile:           ~25-40 seconds (~0.5-0.7 minutes)
#
# Total processing time:
#   - Sequential (1 worker):    266 × 0.6 min = 2.7 hours
#   - Parallel (2 workers):     2.7 / 1.7 = ~1.6 hours (with I/O overlap)
#   - Conservative estimate:    ~2-3 hours (accounting for overhead)
#   - Pessimistic estimate:     ~4-6 hours (if disk I/O is slow)
#
# Compare to original config (with RGB/IRC):
#   - With RGB/IRC:             266 × 4-6 min = ~18-27 hours
#   - This config:              ~2-6 hours
#   - SPEEDUP:                  3-9x faster!
#
# =============================================================================
# MEMORY USAGE (with 2 workers)
# =============================================================================
#
# Per worker:
#   - LAZ file in memory:       ~1-2 GB (18M points)
#   - Feature computation:      ~1-2 GB (GPU VRAM + CPU buffers)
#   - Patch extraction:         ~0.5-1 GB
#   - Total per worker:         ~3-5 GB
#
# Total system usage:
#   - 2 workers × 4 GB =        ~8 GB
#   - System overhead:          ~2 GB
#   - TOTAL:                    ~10 GB
#   - Available:                26 GB
#   - Safety margin:            16 GB (very safe!)
#
# If you experience memory pressure, reduce num_workers to 1.
#
# =============================================================================
# TO ADD RGB/IRC LATER (if needed)
# =============================================================================
#
# If you need RGB/IRC colors for specific tasks, you can:
#
# 1. Process again with a separate config:
#    - Set use_rgb: true, use_infrared: true
#    - Set only_enriched_laz: true (skip patch creation)
#    - This will create enriched LAZ files only (~2-3 hours)
#
# 2. Then re-run patch extraction on enriched LAZ:
#    - Load enriched LAZ (already has RGB/IRC)
#    - Extract patches quickly (~1-2 hours)
#
# Total time for RGB/IRC later: ~3-5 hours (vs 18-27 hours upfront)
#
# =============================================================================
# QUALITY NOTES
# =============================================================================
#
# Despite the optimizations, this config maintains high quality:
#
# ✅ k=20 neighbors:
#    - Still sufficient for robust geometric features
#    - Literature shows k=15-25 is optimal for most LiDAR data
#    - k=30 was slightly overkill for dense IGN HD data
#
# ✅ SOR k=5:
#    - Still effective for outlier removal
#    - Voxel downsampling already removes many outliers
#    - Relaxed std_multiplier (2.5) compensates for lower k
#
# ✅ GPU voxel (0.08m):
#    - Already reduces noise and artifacts
#    - Provides uniform point density
#    - Combined with SOR, very effective preprocessing
#
# ✅ No RGB/IRC:
#    - For training, geometric features often matter more
#    - RGB/IRC can introduce color bias
#    - Easier to generalize across different regions
#
