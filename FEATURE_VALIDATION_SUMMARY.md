# Feature Validation Implementation Summary

## Date: October 9, 2025

## Problem Solved

Fixed the critical bug where `geo_features` was being created as a numpy array in boundary-aware processing, but then used as a dictionary causing:

```
ValueError: dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 4; 2 is required
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed geo_features Format (processor.py)

**Before:**

```python
# Created as numpy array
geo_features = np.column_stack([
    features['planarity'],
    features['linearity'],
    features['sphericity'],
    features['verticality']
])
```

**After:**

```python
# Created as dictionary (consistent with standard processing)
geo_features = {}
for feat_name in ['planarity', 'linearity', 'sphericity', 'verticality']:
    if feat_name in features:
        geo_features[feat_name] = features[feat_name]

if not geo_features:
    geo_features = None
```

### 2. Added Feature Validation (features_boundary.py)

Implemented `_validate_features()` method to detect and drop buggy features:

#### Artifact Detection Logic

| Feature         | Artifact Type    | Detection Criteria       | Action |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------ |
| **Linearity**   | Scan lines       | mean > 0.8 AND std < 0.1 | Drop   |
| **Planarity**   | Constant values  | std < 0.05               | Drop   |
| **Planarity**   | Discontinuities  | std > 0.4                | Drop   |
| **Verticality** | Bimodal extremes | extreme_ratio > 0.95     | Drop   |
| **All**         | Invalid values   | NaN or Inf detected      | Drop   |
| **All**         | Out of range     | value < 0 OR value > 1   | Drop   |

### 3. Integration into Processing Pipeline

The validation is automatically invoked during feature computation:

```python
# After computing all features
if num_boundary > 0:
    logger.debug("Validating features for artifacts...")
    results = self._validate_features(results, boundary_mask)
```

### 4. Graceful Degradation

- Only problematic features are dropped
- Processing continues with remaining valid features
- Clear warning messages indicate which features were dropped
- If all geo_features dropped, continues with normals, curvature, height, RGB

## Test Results

Created comprehensive test suite (`test_feature_validation.py`) covering:

1. ‚úÖ Valid features pass validation
2. ‚úÖ Linearity scan line artifacts detected and dropped
3. ‚úÖ Planarity discontinuities detected and dropped
4. ‚úÖ Verticality bimodal extremes detected and dropped
5. ‚úÖ NaN/Inf values detected and dropped
6. ‚úÖ Validation skipped when no boundary points

**All 6 tests passed successfully!**

## Example Output

```log
[INFO] Computing features with boundary awareness: 15692509 core + 611703 buffer = 16304212 total points
[INFO] Detected 1124198/15692509 points near boundaries (7.2%)
[INFO] Feature computation complete: 7 feature types computed
[INFO] Validating features for artifacts...
[WARNING] ‚ö†Ô∏è  Feature 'linearity' shows line artifact pattern (mean=0.849, std=0.018) - dropping
[INFO] üîç Feature validation: dropping 1 problematic features: ['linearity']
[INFO] ‚úì Boundary-aware features computed (1124198 boundary points affected)
```

## Benefits

1. **Bug Fixed**: Resolves the immediate crash from dict/array mismatch
2. **Quality Assurance**: Automatically detects and removes low-quality features
3. **Robustness**: Processing continues even with artifact detection
4. **Transparency**: Clear logging of validation decisions
5. **Maintainability**: Well-tested validation logic

## Files Modified

- `/ign_lidar/core/processor.py`: Fixed geo_features format, added graceful degradation
- `/ign_lidar/features/features_boundary.py`: Added `_validate_features()` method

## Files Created

- `/FEATURE_VALIDATION.md`: Comprehensive documentation
- `/test_feature_validation.py`: Test suite for validation logic

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test with real LOD3 hybrid dataset
2. Monitor validation statistics across multiple tiles
3. Tune thresholds based on real-world artifact patterns
4. Consider ML-based artifact detection for future versions

## Status

‚úÖ **Implementation Complete and Tested**

The processing pipeline can now handle:

- Boundary-aware feature computation
- Automatic artifact detection
- Graceful degradation when features are problematic
- Consistent data structures throughout the pipeline
