# GPU Chunked Enhanced Features Update

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed Successfully

---

## Overview

Updated `features_gpu_chunked.py` to achieve **full feature parity** with `features_gpu.py` by adding three critical enhanced feature computation methods that were previously missing.

---

## Problem Identified

The GPU chunked processing module (`features_gpu_chunked.py`) was missing 15 enhanced features that were already implemented in the regular GPU module (`features_gpu.py`). This meant that users processing large datasets (>10M points) with `use_gpu_chunked: true` could not access LOD3 enhanced features.

### Missing Features:

- ‚ùå **7 Eigenvalue features**: eigenvalue_1, eigenvalue_2, eigenvalue_3, sum_eigenvalues, eigenentropy, omnivariance, change_curvature
- ‚ùå **4 Architectural features**: edge_strength, corner_likelihood, overhang_indicator, surface_roughness
- ‚ùå **4 Density features**: density, num_points_2m, neighborhood_extent, height_extent_ratio

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Three Enhanced Methods to `GPUChunkedFeatureComputer` Class

Added the following methods to `/mnt/d/Users/Simon/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/IGN_LIDAR_HD_DATASET/ign_lidar/features/features_gpu_chunked.py`:

#### Method 1: `compute_eigenvalue_features()`

```python
def compute_eigenvalue_features(
    self,
    points: np.ndarray,
    normals: np.ndarray,
    neighbors_indices: np.ndarray
) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Compute eigenvalue-based features (GPU-accelerated with chunking support).

    Returns 7 features:
    - eigenvalue_1, eigenvalue_2, eigenvalue_3
    - sum_eigenvalues, eigenentropy
    - omnivariance, change_curvature
    """
```

#### Method 2: `compute_architectural_features()`

```python
def compute_architectural_features(
    self,
    points: np.ndarray,
    normals: np.ndarray,
    neighbors_indices: np.ndarray
) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Compute architectural features for building detection.

    Returns 4 features:
    - edge_strength, corner_likelihood
    - overhang_indicator, surface_roughness
    """
```

#### Method 3: `compute_density_features()`

```python
def compute_density_features(
    self,
    points: np.ndarray,
    neighbors_indices: np.ndarray,
    radius_2m: float = 2.0
) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Compute density and neighborhood features.

    Returns 4 features:
    - density, num_points_2m
    - neighborhood_extent, height_extent_ratio
    """
```

### 2. Added API-Compatible Wrapper Functions

Added three standalone wrapper functions at the end of `features_gpu_chunked.py`:

```python
def compute_eigenvalue_features(points, normals, neighbors_indices)
def compute_architectural_features(points, normals, neighbors_indices)
def compute_density_features(points, neighbors_indices, radius_2m=2.0)
```

These functions provide the same API as the CPU and GPU versions, ensuring consistency across all processing modes.

### 3. Created Comprehensive Test Suite

Created `/mnt/d/Users/Simon/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/IGN_LIDAR_HD_DATASET/tests/test_gpu_chunked_enhanced_features.py` with 5 test cases:

1. **Eigenvalue Features Test** - Validates all 7 eigenvalue-based features
2. **Architectural Features Test** - Validates all 4 architectural features
3. **Density Features Test** - Validates all 4 density features
4. **Wrapper Functions Test** - Validates API compatibility
5. **Feature Parity Test** - Compares GPU vs GPU Chunked outputs

## Benefits

### 1. **Consistency Across Processing Modes**

Users now get the same features regardless of whether they use:

- CPU processing
- GPU processing (small/medium datasets)
- GPU chunked processing (large datasets >10M points)

### 2. **LOD3 Training Support for Large Datasets**

Can now train LOD3 models with full architectural features on:

- Large tiles (>10M points)
- Multiple tiles processed in sequence
- Memory-constrained GPU environments

### 3. **Backward Compatibility**

All existing code continues to work:

- Same function names
- Same parameter signatures
- Same return types

### 4. **Future-Proof Architecture**

When new features are added, they can be implemented consistently across all three modes.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Using GPU Chunked for Large Dataset

```python
from ign_lidar.features.features_gpu_chunked import GPUChunkedFeatureComputer
from sklearn.neighbors import KDTree

# Large point cloud (10M+ points)
points = load_large_point_cloud()
classification = load_classification()

# Initialize GPU chunked computer
computer = GPUChunkedFeatureComputer(
    chunk_size=5_000_000,  # Process 5M points at a time
    vram_limit_gb=8.0,      # Limit VRAM usage
    use_gpu=True
)

# Compute normals
normals = computer.compute_normals_chunked(points, k=10)

# Build KDTree for neighbors
tree = KDTree(points, metric='euclidean')
_, neighbors_indices = tree.query(points, k=10)

# Compute enhanced features
eigenvalue_feats = computer.compute_eigenvalue_features(
    points, normals, neighbors_indices
)
architectural_feats = computer.compute_architectural_features(
    points, normals, neighbors_indices
)
density_feats = computer.compute_density_features(
    points, neighbors_indices, radius_2m=2.0
)

# All features available for LOD3 training!
```

### Example 2: Using Wrapper Functions

```python
from ign_lidar.features import features_gpu_chunked

# Compute features using wrapper functions (simpler API)
eig_features = features_gpu_chunked.compute_eigenvalue_features(
    points, normals, neighbors_indices
)
arch_features = features_gpu_chunked.compute_architectural_features(
    points, normals, neighbors_indices
)
density_features = features_gpu_chunked.compute_density_features(
    points, neighbors_indices
)
```

### Example 3: Configuration File with GPU Chunked

```yaml
# config_lod3_training_large.yaml
processing:
  use_gpu: true
  use_gpu_chunked: true # Enable chunked processing for large tiles
  chunk_size: 5000000 # 5M points per chunk

features:
  mode: "lod3" # Full LOD3 features including enhanced features
  k_neighbors: 10
# Now all 37 LOD3 features will be computed, even for massive datasets!
```
