# Docusaurus French Translation Analysis & Update Summary

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Analyst:** GitHub Copilot  
**Status:** ✅ ANALYSIS COMPLETE & CRITICAL UPDATES APPLIED

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive analysis of the IGN LIDAR HD Docusaurus documentation revealed that the French translation was generally well-maintained (56/57 files translated), but two **critical** files needed immediate attention:

1. **`intro.md`** (Homepage) - Outdated with v1.7.4 focus, needed v1.7.5 vectorization content
2. **`guides/getting-started.md`** - Only a 31-line placeholder, needed complete 492-line translation

Both files have been successfully updated and now accurately reflect the v1.7.5 release with its groundbreaking 100-200x performance improvements.

### File Status Breakdown

#### ✅ Excellent (48 files)

Fully translated, up-to-date, no issues detected.

#### ⚠️ Needs Attention (9 files)

English version is newer than French:

1. `features/smart-skip.md`
2. `guides/gpu-acceleration.md`
3. `release-notes/v1.5.0.md`
4. `release-notes/v1.6.0.md`
5. `release-notes/v1.7.0.md`
6. `release-notes/v1.7.2.md`
7. `release-notes/v1.7.3.md`
8. `release-notes/v1.7.4.md`
9. `intro.md` ← **FIXED ✅**

#### 📝 Content Differences (7 files)

Significant line count differences (may have extra French content):

1. `guides/basic-usage.md` - 345 EN vs 186 FR
2. `guides/preprocessing.md` - 503 EN vs 783 FR (FR has more!)
3. `guides/qgis-troubleshooting.md` - 76 EN vs 251 FR (FR has more!)
4. `reference/cli-qgis.md` - 293 EN vs 190 FR

   - Review files where FR has more content than EN:
     - `guides/preprocessing.md` (783 FR vs 503 EN)
     - `guides/qgis-troubleshooting.md` (251 FR vs 76 EN)
     - `reference/config-examples.md` (233 FR vs 114 EN)
   - Determine if French additions should be added to English docs
   - Estimated effort: 4-6 hours

   - Run comparison script monthly
   - Set up GitHub Actions for translation validation
   - Create issues automatically for outdated translations

2. **Translation Workflow**

   - Document translation process
   - Create translation guidelines document
   - Consider translation memory/glossary

3. **Version Tagging**
   - Tag each translation with version number
   - Add metadata to track translation dates
   - Implement "last updated" notices

## Maintenance Strategy

### Regular Checks

```bash
# Run monthly comparison
cd website
python3 << 'EOF'
# [Comparison script from this session]
EOF
```

### Update Process

1. **When adding new EN content:**

   - Create FR version immediately or mark as "needs translation"
   - Add to tracking issue

2. **When updating EN content:**

   - Check if FR needs update (compare timestamps)
   - Update FR within 1 week for critical pages
   - Update FR within 1 month for other pages

3. **For releases:**
   - Release notes should be translated same day
   - Homepage should be updated same day
   - Other docs within 1 week

### Quality Criteria

Translation is considered complete when:

- ✅ All text content translated (code can remain in English)
- ✅ Natural French language flow
- ✅ Technical accuracy verified
- ✅ Links updated to French versions
- ✅ Formatting/structure preserved
- ✅ No placeholders or "needs translation" markers
