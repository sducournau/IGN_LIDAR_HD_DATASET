| Geometric Features  | Caractéristiques géométriques |
| Patches             | Patches (keep English term)   |
| Training            | Entraînement                  |
| Dataset             | Jeu de données                |
| Enrichment          | Enrichissement                |

### Code Examples

- Keep code snippets in English (commands, variable names)
- Translate comments and explanations
- Update file paths to French equivalents:
  - `raw_tiles/` → `tuiles_brutes/`
  - `enriched_tiles/` → `tuiles_enrichies/`
  - `/path/to/` → `/chemin/vers/`

### Mermaid Diagrams

- Translate labels and text within diagrams

## Update Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. ✅ **Update `guides/basic-usage.md`** (COMPLETED)
2. 🔴 **Update high priority files:**
   - `api/configuration.md`
   - `guides/qgis-troubleshooting.md`
   - `guides/preprocessing.md`

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)

3. 🟡 **Update medium priority files** (8 files)
   - Focus on user-facing guides first
   - Then update API reference docs

### Long-term (Next Month)

4. 🟢 **Batch update low priority files** (21 files)
5. 📝 **Remove or migrate extra French files**
6. 🧪 **Test Docusaurus build after each batch**

---

## Automation Tools

### Translation Script Created

A Python script `update_french_translations.py` has been created with:

- Automatic terminology mapping
- Structure preservation
- Frontmatter handling
- Bulk update capabilities

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 update_french_translations.py
```

### Manual Review Required

Even with automation, the following require manual review:

- Technical accuracy
- Context-specific translations
- Code comments
- Diagrams and flowcharts
- Links and cross-references

---

## Testing Checklist

After updating translations:

- [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify no build errors
- [ ] Check French site locally: `npm start -- --locale fr`
- [ ] Verify internal links work correctly
- [ ] Check Mermaid diagrams render properly
- [ ] Test search functionality in French
- [ ] Verify mobile responsive design
- [ ] Check syntax highlighting in code blocks

---

## Build Issues

### Current Build Status

Last build attempt failed. Common issues:

- Broken internal links
- Missing frontmatter fields
- Duplicate headings (MD025 errors)
- Invalid Mermaid syntax

**Resolution:**

1. Fix linting errors before building
2. Use `npm run lint` to check markdown quality
3. Validate Mermaid diagrams separately
