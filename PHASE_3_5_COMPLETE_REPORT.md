## 📊 Detailed Metrics

### Line Count Evolution

```
Original (pre-Phase 3):     ~2,942 lines
After Phase 3.4:            2,684 lines (9% reduction)
After Phase 3.5:            1,146 lines (61% reduction from original!)

Phase 3.5 Impact:           -1,538 lines (57% in one step)
```

### What Was Removed

- **Legacy process_tile method:** 1,536 lines
  - Started at line 1148
  - Old monolithic implementation
  - Pre-Phase 3.4 code
  - Not being called anymore
- **Orphaned code:** 2 lines
  - Method signature fragments
  - Cleanup artifacts

### What Remains (1,146 lines)

- `__init__` method: ~121 lines
- Config properties: ~150 lines (25 @property decorators)
- Refactored `process_tile`: ~265 lines (uses modules)
- `process_directory`: ~185 lines
- `_save_patch_as_laz`: ~212 lines
- Other utilities: ~213 lines

**All legitimate, functional code!**

## ✅ Validation Results

### 1. Import Test ✅

```python
from ign_lidar.core.processor import LiDARProcessor
```

**Result:** ✅ Module imports successfully

### 2. Integration Test ✅

```bash
python tests/test_phase_3_4_integration.py
```

**Result:** ✅ Test PASSED

- Processor initialized correctly
- TileLoader and FeatureComputer working
- Processed 50,000 points
- Created 1 patch (2048 points)
- Saved NPZ file (104.8 KB)
- All arrays present and valid

### 3. Method Count

```bash
grep "^    def " processor.py | wc -l
```

**Result:** 30 methods (no duplicates)

---

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Discovery Process

1. Analyzed processor.py with awk to count lines per method
2. Found `process_tile( 1536` - suspiciously large!
3. Checked for duplicate methods: found TWO process_tile implementations
4. Verified which one is being called (refactored version)
5. Identified safe deletion target (legacy version)

### Removal Process

1. Located legacy method: lines 1148-2684
2. Verified refactored method is at line 698 (different signature)
3. Used `head -1146` to keep only lines before legacy method
4. Verified file integrity
5. Ran validation tests

### Safety Checks

- ✅ Refactored version has different signature
- ✅ Integration test uses refactored version
- ✅ No callers to legacy version found
- ✅ Tests pass after removal
- ✅ Module imports correctly
