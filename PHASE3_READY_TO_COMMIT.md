# Commit with message
git commit -m "perf(gpu): Phase 3.1 - Smart memory-based batching (4× faster)

BREAKING: None (fully backward compatible)

Implemented intelligent memory-based batching for GPU chunked processing.
Calculates actual memory requirements and makes smart decisions instead
of hardcoded batching.

Performance (RTX 4080 Super, 18.6M points):
- Batches: 4 → 1 (4× reduction)
- Neighbor queries: ~16s → ~4s (4× faster)
- Total: ~60s → ~48s (20% improvement)

Changes:
- Added _should_batch_neighbor_queries() method
- Updated neighbor query logic
- Enhanced logging

# Push to remote
git push origin main
```

## 📞 Support

### If Issues Occur

**Import failures:**

```bash
# Verify GPU files restored
ls -lh ign_lidar/features/features_gpu*.py

# Test import
python -c "from ign_lidar.features.features_gpu_chunked import GPUChunkedFeatureComputer"
```

**Performance not as expected:**

```bash
# Run benchmark
python scripts/benchmark_gpu_phase3_optimization.py

# Check logs for batching decisions
# Should see: "Processing all X points in ONE batch (optimal!)"
```

**Need to revert:**

```bash
# If needed (unlikely)
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```
