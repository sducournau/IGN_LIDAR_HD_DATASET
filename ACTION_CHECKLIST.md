- [ ] **NEXT: Commit comprehensive update to Git**

### This Week

- [ ] Test full workflow (download ‚Üí enrich ‚Üí process)
- [ ] Verify smart skip detection works for all commands
- [ ] Test with different configurations (core vs building mode)
- [ ] Measure performance (files per second, memory usage)
- [ ] Test QGIS compatibility if needed (`--auto-convert-qgis`)
- [ ] Run unit tests (`pytest tests/`)

### Next 2 Weeks

- [ ] Start Docusaurus site (2-hour quick start or full implementation)
- [ ] Create visual documentation (diagrams, screenshots)
- [ ] Add more examples and tutorials
- [ ] Test GPU acceleration (`--use-gpu`)
- [ ] Deploy documentation to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Write blog post/announcement

## üîç Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality

- [ ] Single file enrichment works
- [ ] Directory enrichment works
- [ ] Smart skip detection works
- [ ] Force reprocessing works (`--force`)
- [ ] Parallel processing works (`--num-workers`)
- [ ] Progress bar displays correctly
- [ ] Statistics are accurate

### Feature Modes

- [ ] Core mode produces expected features
- [ ] Building mode produces all features
- [ ] Feature quality is good (normals, curvature, etc.)
- [ ] Output LAZ files are valid

### Performance

- [ ] Multi-worker processing is faster
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable
- [ ] No memory leaks on long runs
- [ ] Smart skip is instant (no file reading)

### Error Handling

- [ ] Missing input directory shows clear error
- [ ] Invalid LAZ files are handled gracefully
- [ ] Permission errors are reported clearly
- [ ] Interruption (Ctrl+C) is handled cleanly

## üêõ Troubleshooting Checklist

If something goes wrong, check:

### 1. Environment Issues

```bash
# Verify Python environment
which python
python --version  # Should be 3.12.3

# Verify package is installed
pip list | grep ign-lidar

# Reinstall if needed
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Command Syntax Issues

```bash
# Always check help first
python -m ign_lidar.cli enrich --help

# Common mistakes:
# ‚ùå --workers (wrong)
# ‚úÖ --num-workers (correct)
# ‚ùå --input for directories (wrong)
# ‚úÖ --input-dir for directories (correct)
```

### 3. Input/Output Issues

```bash
# Check input directory exists
ls -lh /mnt/c/Users/Simon/ign/raw_tiles/

# Check output directory is writable
mkdir -p /mnt/c/Users/Simon/ign/pre_tiles/
touch /mnt/c/Users/Simon/ign/pre_tiles/test.txt
rm /mnt/c/Users/Simon/ign/pre_tiles/test.txt
```

### 4. Memory Issues

```bash
# Monitor memory usage during processing
htop  # or top

# If running out of memory:
# Reduce --num-workers from 6 to 2 or 3
```

### 5. Permission Issues

```bash
# Fix permissions if needed
chmod -R u+w /mnt/c/Users/Simon/ign/pre_tiles/
```

## üìä Success Criteria

### Enrichment Should:

1. ‚úÖ Process LAZ files without errors
2. ‚úÖ Create enriched files with `_enriched.laz` suffix
3. ‚úÖ Add geometric features (normals, curvature, etc.)
4. ‚úÖ Skip existing enriched files on re-run
5. ‚úÖ Show accurate statistics (skipped/success/failed)
6. ‚úÖ Complete in reasonable time (depends on file size)

### Output Files Should:

1. ‚úÖ Be valid LAZ 1.4 files
2. ‚úÖ Contain original points plus new features
3. ‚úÖ Be similar size to input (maybe 10-20% larger)
4. ‚úÖ Be readable by other tools (CloudCompare, etc.)

## üéØ Performance Benchmarks

Expected performance (approximate):

| File Size | Workers | Time per File | Features |
| --------- | ------- | ------------- | -------- |
| 500 MB    | 1       | 5-10 min      | Building |
| 500 MB    | 4       | 2-3 min       | Building |
| 1 GB      | 1       | 10-20 min     | Building |
| 1 GB      | 4       | 4-6 min       | Building |
| 500 MB    | 1       | 3-5 min       | Core     |

Your mileage may vary based on:

- CPU speed
- Disk I/O speed
- Point cloud density
- Feature mode (core vs building)

## üí° Quick Tips

### 1. Always use Python module syntax

```bash
python -m ign_lidar.cli <command>
```

Most reliable, works everywhere.

### 2. Check help before running

```bash
python -m ign_lidar.cli enrich --help
```

Shows all options and correct names.

### 3. Start small

Test with one file before processing hundreds:

```bash
python -m ign_lidar.cli enrich \
  --input single_file.laz \
  --output test_output/
```

### 4. Monitor resources

Use `htop` to watch CPU and memory usage during processing.

### 5. Use smart skip

Let the tool skip existing files - it's instant and saves time.

‚úÖ Package installed and verified  
‚úÖ Documentation complete and accurate
