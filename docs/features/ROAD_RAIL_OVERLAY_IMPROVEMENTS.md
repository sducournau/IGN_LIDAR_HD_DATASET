## 📋 Summary of Changes

### 1. **Enhanced Configuration Parameters** ✅

#### File: `ign_lidar/core/modules/classification_refinement.py`

**Added new parameters to `RefinementConfig` class:**

```python
# Road-specific parameters (improved)
ROAD_BUFFER_TOLERANCE = 0.5    # Increased from 0.3m for better coverage
ROAD_HEIGHT_MAX = 1.5          # NEW: Maximum height above ground
ROAD_HEIGHT_MIN = -0.3         # NEW: Minimum height (terrain variations)
ROAD_PLANARITY_MIN = 0.6       # NEW: Minimum planarity threshold
ROAD_INTENSITY_FILTER = True   # Use intensity filtering
ROAD_MIN_INTENSITY = 0.15      # Lowered from 0.2 (dark surfaces)
ROAD_MAX_INTENSITY = 0.7       # Increased from 0.6 (concrete)

# Railway-specific parameters (NEW)
RAIL_BUFFER_TOLERANCE = 0.6    # Wider tolerance for ballast
RAIL_HEIGHT_MAX = 1.2          # Maximum height above ground
RAIL_HEIGHT_MIN = -0.2         # Minimum height
RAIL_PLANARITY_MIN = 0.5       # Less strict than roads (ballast texture)
RAIL_INTENSITY_FILTER = True   # Use intensity filtering
RAIL_MIN_INTENSITY = 0.1       # Dark ballast
RAIL_MAX_INTENSITY = 0.8       # Bright metal rails
```

**Key Improvements:**

- ✅ Separate parameters for roads and railways
- ✅ Height filtering to exclude bridges/overpasses
- ✅ Planarity thresholds adapted to surface types
- ✅ Wider intensity ranges for diverse materials

---

### 2. **Geometric Filtering in Classification** ✅

#### File: `ign_lidar/core/modules/advanced_classification.py`

**Updated methods:**

- `_classify_by_ground_truth()` - Now passes geometric features
- `_classify_roads_with_buffer()` - Added multi-stage filtering
- `_classify_railways_with_buffer()` - Added multi-stage filtering

**New Filtering Logic:**

```python
# Height Filter - Exclude bridges and overpasses
if height[i] > 1.5 or height[i] < -0.3:
    passes_filters = False
    filtered_counts['height'] += 1

# Planarity Filter - Roads should be relatively flat
if planarity[i] < 0.6:
    passes_filters = False
    filtered_counts['planarity'] += 1

# Intensity Filter - Asphalt/concrete reflectance
if intensity[i] < 0.15 or intensity[i] > 0.7:
    passes_filters = False
    filtered_counts['intensity'] += 1
```

**Features:**

- ✅ **Height filtering**: Removes points from bridges, viaducts, overpasses
- ✅ **Planarity filtering**: Ensures surface is relatively flat
- ✅ **Intensity filtering**: Matches surface reflectance characteristics
- ✅ **Statistics logging**: Tracks how many points are filtered by each criterion

**Example Output:**

```
Using intelligent road buffers (tolerance=0.5m)
Road widths: 3.0m - 12.5m (avg: 6.2m)
Classified 45,230 road points from 87 roads
Avg points per road: 520
Filtered out: height=1,234, planarity=567, intensity=891
```

### 3. **Improved Adaptive Buffering** ✅

#### File: `ign_lidar/core/modules/transport_enhancement.py`

**Enhanced `AdaptiveBufferConfig` class:**

```python
# Improved tolerances
tolerance_motorway: float = 0.6      # Increased for highways with shoulders
tolerance_primary: float = 0.5       # Major roads
tolerance_secondary: float = 0.4     # Regional roads
tolerance_residential: float = 0.35  # Increased for urban roads
tolerance_service: float = 0.25      # Increased for narrow roads
tolerance_railway_main: float = 0.7  # Increased for ballast coverage
tolerance_railway_tram: float = 0.4  # Increased for embedded trams

# Enhanced curvature awareness
curvature_factor: float = 0.25       # Increased from 0.2
intersection_threshold: float = 1.5  # Increased from 1.0
intersection_buffer_multiplier: float = 1.6  # Increased from 1.5

# NEW elevation-aware filtering
elevation_min: float = -0.3          # Minimum valid height
elevation_max_road: float = 1.5      # Max height for ground-level roads
elevation_max_rail: float = 1.2      # Max height for ground-level railways
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Better coverage at curves and intersections
- ✅ Type-specific tolerances for different road categories
- ✅ Wider buffers for railways to capture ballast
- ✅ Built-in elevation awareness

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Height Filtering Logic

**Purpose:** Exclude bridges, overpasses, viaducts, and elevated structures

**Implementation:**

```python
# For roads
if height[i] > 1.5 or height[i] < -0.3:
    # Point is too high (bridge) or too low (invalid)
    passes_filters = False

# For railways
if height[i] > 1.2 or height[i] < -0.2:
    # Railway bridges or invalid points
    passes_filters = False
```

**Rationale:**

- Ground-level roads/rails are typically within ±0.5m of terrain
- 1.5m max height allows for slight embankments but excludes bridges
- Negative height minimum allows for terrain variations and drainage

---

### Planarity Filtering Logic

**Purpose:** Ensure surface is relatively flat (characteristic of transport infrastructure)

**Implementation:**

```python
# For roads (stricter)
if planarity[i] < 0.6:
    passes_filters = False

# For railways (more tolerant)
if planarity[i] < 0.5:
    passes_filters = False
```

**Rationale:**

- Roads are paved and very planar (0.6+ threshold)
- Railways have ballast texture, less planar than roads (0.5+ threshold)
- Filters out vegetation, rough terrain, buildings misclassified in buffer zone

---

### Intensity Filtering Logic

**Purpose:** Match surface reflectance characteristics of transport infrastructure

**Implementation:**

```python
# For roads (asphalt/concrete)
if intensity[i] < 0.15 or intensity[i] > 0.7:
    passes_filters = False

# For railways (ballast + metal)
if intensity[i] < 0.1 or intensity[i] > 0.8:
    passes_filters = False
```

**Rationale:**

- Asphalt: medium-low reflectance (0.2-0.4)
- Concrete: medium-high reflectance (0.4-0.6)
- Ballast: low reflectance (0.1-0.3)
- Metal rails: high reflectance (0.5-0.8)
- Filters out very dark (shadows) and very bright (buildings) points

## 🚀 Usage

### For Standard Processing

No changes needed - improvements are automatic:

```bash
python -m ign_lidar.cli.commands.process \
  --config-file configs/processing_config.yaml \
  input_dir=data/raw \
  output_dir=data/processed
```

### For Custom Configurations

Adjust parameters in your config file:

```yaml
data_sources:
  bd_topo:
    parameters:
      # Adjust tolerances
      road_buffer_tolerance: 0.5 # More coverage
      railway_buffer_tolerance: 0.6 # Wider for ballast

      # Adjust height filters
      road_height_max: 1.5 # Stricter for flat areas
      rail_height_max: 1.2

      # Adjust planarity
      road_planarity_min: 0.7 # Stricter for urban roads
      rail_planarity_min: 0.5
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Too Few Points Classified

**Symptom:** Roads/railways have very few points after filtering

**Solutions:**

1. Increase height thresholds:
   ```yaml
   road_height_max: 2.0 # More tolerant
   ```
2. Lower planarity requirement:
   ```yaml
   road_planarity_min: 0.5 # More tolerant
   ```
3. Widen intensity range:
   ```yaml
   road_intensity_min: 0.1
   road_intensity_max: 0.8
   ```
4. Disable specific filters temporarily:
   ```yaml
   enable_intensity_filter: false
   ```

### Too Many False Positives

**Symptom:** Non-road/rail points still being classified

**Solutions:**

1. Tighten height filter:
   ```yaml
   road_height_max: 1.2 # Stricter
   ```
2. Increase planarity requirement:
   ```yaml
   road_planarity_min: 0.7 # Stricter
   ```
3. Narrow intensity range:
   ```yaml
   road_intensity_min: 0.2
   road_intensity_max: 0.6
   ```

### Bridges Still Classified as Roads

**Symptom:** Elevated road sections still included

**Solutions:**

1. Lower height threshold:
   ```yaml
   road_height_max: 1.0 # Very strict
   ```
2. Check that height features are being computed:
   ```yaml
   compute_features:
     compute_height: true # Must be enabled
   ```

## 📝 Verification

### Check Classification Quality

```python
import laspy
import numpy as np

# Load enriched file
las = laspy.read("output/enriched/tile_name.laz")

# Analyze road classification
road_mask = las.classification == 11
if road_mask.any():
    road_heights = las.z[road_mask] - np.min(las.z[road_mask])
    print(f"Road height range: {road_heights.min():.2f}m - {road_heights.max():.2f}m")
    print(f"Road points: {road_mask.sum():,}")

# Analyze railway classification
rail_mask = las.classification == 10
if rail_mask.any():
    rail_heights = las.z[rail_mask] - np.min(las.z[rail_mask])
    print(f"Rail height range: {rail_heights.min():.2f}m - {rail_heights.max():.2f}m")
    print(f"Rail points: {rail_mask.sum():,}")
```

### Expected Output

```
Road height range: -0.25m - 1.45m
Road points: 45,230
Rail height range: -0.15m - 1.18m
Rail points: 12,450
```
