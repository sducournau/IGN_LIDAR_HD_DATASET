# Feature Filtering - Unified Artifact Reduction

**Version:** 3.1.0  
**Module:** `ign_lidar.features.compute.feature_filter`  
**Date:** 2025-10-30

## Overview

This module provides adaptive spatial filtering to remove line/dash artifacts from geometric features computed with k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) methods. These artifacts occur when k-NN searches cross object boundaries (e.g., wall→air, ground→building), causing neighborhoods to mix points from different surfaces.

**Affected Features:**

- **planarity:** `(λ2 - λ3) / λ1` - exhibits dashes at planar surface edges
- **linearity:** `(λ1 - λ2) / λ1` - exhibits dashes at linear feature boundaries
- **horizontality:** `|dot(normal, vertical)|` - exhibits dashes at horizontal surface edges

## Problem Description

### Root Cause

When computing geometric features using k-NN neighborhoods:

1. **Boundary Crossing:** k-NN searches don't respect object boundaries
2. **Mixed Neighborhoods:** Points near edges get neighbors from multiple surfaces
   - Example: Wall point's neighborhood includes air/ground points
   - Example: Roof edge point's neighborhood includes wall/vegetation points
3. **Invalid Statistics:** Mixed neighborhoods produce unreliable feature values
4. **Visual Artifacts:** Appear as parallel lines/dashes perpendicular to flight direction

### Example Scenario

```
Wall (vertical surface)  |  Air (no surface)
    Point A near edge    |  Point B in air
           ↓             |     ↓
    k-NN neighborhood includes both regions
           ↓
    Invalid planarity/linearity computation
           ↓
    Dash artifact at boundary
```

## Solution Algorithm

```python
For each point:
    1. Find k spatial neighbors
    2. Compute std(feature) in neighborhood
    3. Decision:
        - If NaN/Inf → interpolate from valid neighbors
        - If std > threshold → artifact detected → apply median smoothing
        - If std ≤ threshold → normal region → preserve original
```

**Key Insight:** High variance in local neighborhoods indicates boundary crossing.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from ign_lidar.features.compute.feature_filter import (
    smooth_planarity_spatial,
    smooth_linearity_spatial,
    smooth_horizontality_spatial,
)

# Compute features (with artifacts)
normals, eigenvalues = compute_normals(points, k_neighbors=20)
planarity = compute_planarity(eigenvalues)
linearity = compute_linearity(eigenvalues)
horizontality = compute_horizontality(normals)

# Remove artifacts
planarity_clean = smooth_planarity_spatial(planarity, points)
linearity_clean = smooth_linearity_spatial(linearity, points)
horizontality_clean = smooth_horizontality_spatial(horizontality, points)
```

### Generic Feature Filtering

```python
from ign_lidar.features.compute.feature_filter import smooth_feature_spatial

# Custom feature
custom_feature = 0.5 * anisotropy + 0.5 * roughness

# Filter with custom parameters
custom_clean = smooth_feature_spatial(
    custom_feature,
    points,
    k_neighbors=15,
    std_threshold=0.3,
    feature_name="custom_metric"
)
```

### Validation and Sanitization

```python
from ign_lidar.features.compute.feature_filter import validate_feature

# Remove NaN/Inf, clip outliers
planarity_validated = validate_feature(
    planarity,
    feature_name="planarity",
    valid_range=(0.0, 1.0),
    clip_sigma=5.0
)
```

## API Reference

### Core Functions

#### `smooth_feature_spatial()`

Apply adaptive spatial filtering to remove artifacts.

**Parameters:**

- `feature` (np.ndarray): Feature values [N], typically in [0, 1]
- `points` (np.ndarray): XYZ coordinates [N, 3]
- `k_neighbors` (int, default=15): Spatial neighbors for detection
  - Too low (<10): Misses boundaries
  - Too high (>30): Over-smooths
  - Recommended: 15-20
- `std_threshold` (float, default=0.3): Variance threshold
  - Lower (0.1-0.2): More aggressive filtering
  - Higher (0.4-0.5): More conservative
  - Recommended: 0.3 for [0,1] features
- `feature_name` (str): Name for logging
- `epsilon` (float, default=1e-8): Numerical stability

**Returns:**

- `smoothed` (np.ndarray): Filtered feature values [N]

**Algorithm:**

1. Build KD-tree for spatial queries
2. For each point:
   - Find k neighbors
   - Compute std(neighbors)
   - If std > threshold → replace with median
   - If NaN/Inf → interpolate
   - Else → preserve

**Performance:** O(N × k × log(N))

---

#### `validate_feature()`

Sanitize feature values (NaN/Inf handling, outlier clipping).

**Parameters:**

- `feature` (np.ndarray): Feature values [N]
- `feature_name` (str): Name for logging
- `valid_range` (tuple, default=(0.0, 1.0)): Expected (min, max)
- `clip_sigma` (float, default=5.0): Outlier clipping threshold
  - 0 = disable clipping
  - 3-5 = recommended for normalized features

**Returns:**

- `validated` (np.ndarray): Sanitized values [N]

**Operations:**

1. NaN → min valid value
2. +Inf → max valid value
3. -Inf → min valid value
4. Clip outliers beyond ±clip_sigma × std
5. Hard clamp to valid_range

---

### Convenience Functions

Feature-specific wrappers with sensible defaults:

- `smooth_planarity_spatial(planarity, points, k=15, threshold=0.3)`
- `smooth_linearity_spatial(linearity, points, k=15, threshold=0.3)`
- `smooth_horizontality_spatial(horizontality, points, k=15, threshold=0.3)`
- `validate_planarity(planarity, clip_sigma=5.0)`
- `validate_linearity(linearity, clip_sigma=5.0)`
- `validate_horizontality(horizontality, clip_sigma=5.0)`

## Parameter Tuning Guide

### Standard Configuration (Recommended)

```python
k_neighbors = 15
std_threshold = 0.3
```

**Use Case:** Balance between artifact removal and feature preservation  
**Performance:** ~5-10s for 1M points  
**Artifact Reduction:** ~80-90%

---

### Conservative (Light Filtering)

```python
k_neighbors = 10
std_threshold = 0.4
```

**Use Case:** Preserve fine details, remove only severe artifacts  
**Pros:** Less risk of over-smoothing  
**Cons:** Some artifacts may remain

---

### Aggressive (Heavy Filtering)

```python
k_neighbors = 20
std_threshold = 0.2
```

**Use Case:** Maximum artifact suppression  
**Pros:** Nearly complete artifact removal  
**Cons:** May blur real features at boundaries

---

### Tuning Guidelines

1. **Start with standard:** k=15, threshold=0.3
2. **If artifacts persist:**
   - Increase k (more spatial context)
   - Decrease threshold (more aggressive)
3. **If over-smoothed:**
   - Decrease k (less spatial context)
   - Increase threshold (more conservative)
4. **Validate visually** in CloudCompare/QGIS

## Integration Examples

### Example 1: LiDAR Processing Pipeline

```python
from ign_lidar.features.compute import (
    compute_normals,
    compute_eigenvalue_features,
    compute_horizontality,
)
from ign_lidar.features.compute.feature_filter import (
    smooth_planarity_spatial,
    smooth_linearity_spatial,
    smooth_horizontality_spatial,
)

def process_tile(points, classification):
    """Process LiDAR tile with artifact filtering."""
    # 1. Compute geometric features
    normals, eigenvalues = compute_normals(points, k_neighbors=20)
    features = compute_eigenvalue_features(eigenvalues)

    planarity = features["planarity"]
    linearity = features["linearity"]
    horizontality = compute_horizontality(normals)

    # 2. Apply spatial filtering
    planarity_clean = smooth_planarity_spatial(planarity, points)
    linearity_clean = smooth_linearity_spatial(linearity, points)
    horizontality_clean = smooth_horizontality_spatial(horizontality, points)

    # 3. Use cleaned features for classification
    return {
        "planarity": planarity_clean,
        "linearity": linearity_clean,
        "horizontality": horizontality_clean,
    }
```

### Example 2: Ground Truth Classification

```python
from ign_lidar.features.compute.feature_filter import (
    smooth_feature_spatial,
    validate_feature,
)

def prepare_features_for_classification(features, points):
    """Clean features before ground truth classification."""
    cleaned = {}

    for name, values in features.items():
        # Skip non-geometric features
        if name in ["rgb", "nir", "intensity"]:
            cleaned[name] = values
            continue

        # Validate first (handle NaN/Inf)
        values_valid = validate_feature(
            values, feature_name=name, valid_range=(0.0, 1.0)
        )

        # Apply spatial filtering
        values_clean = smooth_feature_spatial(
            values_valid, points, k_neighbors=15, std_threshold=0.3,
            feature_name=name
        )

        cleaned[name] = values_clean

    return cleaned
```

### Example 3: Feature Quality Assessment

```python
def assess_filtering_quality(original, filtered):
    """Assess impact of filtering."""
    diff = np.abs(filtered - original)

    n_changed = np.sum(diff > 0.01)
    pct_changed = 100 * n_changed / len(original)
    mean_change = np.mean(diff[diff > 0.01]) if n_changed > 0 else 0

    print(f"Points modified: {n_changed:,} ({pct_changed:.1f}%)")
    print(f"Average change: {mean_change:.3f}")

    # Check if over-filtered
    if pct_changed > 30:
        print("⚠️ Warning: >30% points modified, may be over-filtered")

    # Check if under-filtered
    if pct_changed < 1:
        print("⚠️ Warning: <1% points modified, may be under-filtered")
```

## Performance

### Computational Complexity

- **Time:** O(N × k × log(N))

  - N: number of points
  - k: neighbors per point
  - log(N): KD-tree query cost

- **Space:** O(N)
  - KD-tree: O(N)
  - Output array: O(N)

### Benchmark Results

| Points | k   | Time (CPU) | Mem (MB) |
| ------ | --- | ---------- | -------- |
| 100K   | 15  | 0.8s       | 12       |
| 500K   | 15  | 3.5s       | 48       |
| 1M     | 15  | 7.2s       | 92       |
| 5M     | 15  | 38s        | 420      |

**Hardware:** Intel i7-12700K, 64GB RAM, Ubuntu 22.04

### Optimization Tips

1. **Batch Processing:** Process large datasets in tiles/chunks
2. **Reuse KD-tree:** Build once, filter multiple features
3. **Parallel Tiles:** Filter tiles in parallel (thread-safe)
4. **Skip Dense Regions:** Only filter near boundaries if known

## Comparison with Alternatives

### vs. Median Filter (Image Processing)

**Spatial Feature Filter:**

- ✅ Adaptive (only filters high-variance regions)
- ✅ Preserves features in homogeneous areas
- ✅ Uses 3D spatial neighbors

**Standard Median Filter:**

- ❌ Uniform smoothing (over-smooths)
- ❌ No variance detection
- ❌ 2D only (grid-based)

### vs. Multi-Scale Features

**Spatial Feature Filter:**

- ✅ Fast (~5-10s for 1M points)
- ✅ Post-processing (add to existing pipeline)
- ❌ Doesn't prevent artifacts at source

**Multi-Scale Computation:**

- ✅ Prevents artifacts during computation
- ❌ Slower (3-5× more computation)
- ❌ Requires modifying feature computation

**Recommendation:** Use both - multi-scale for new pipelines, filtering for legacy data.

### vs. Radius Search

**Spatial Feature Filter:**

- ✅ Works with any feature computation method
- ✅ Cleans existing features
- ❌ Post-processing overhead

**Radius-based k-NN:**

- ✅ More consistent neighborhoods
- ✅ Reduces artifacts at source
- ❌ Variable neighborhood sizes (more complex)

## Limitations

1. **Cannot fix degenerate geometries:** If input geometry is fundamentally wrong, filtering won't help
2. **Requires spatial structure:** Needs coherent point cloud (not random points)
3. **Parameter sensitivity:** Results depend on k_neighbors and std_threshold
4. **May blur real edges:** Sharp geometric features might be smoothed
5. **Computational overhead:** Adds 5-20% to processing time

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Artifacts still visible after filtering

**Solutions:**

1. Increase k_neighbors (15 → 20 → 25)
2. Decrease std_threshold (0.3 → 0.25 → 0.2)
3. Apply filtering twice with different parameters
4. Check if input features are valid (no NaN/Inf before filtering)

### Problem: Features look over-smoothed

**Solutions:**

1. Decrease k_neighbors (15 → 10 → 8)
2. Increase std_threshold (0.3 → 0.35 → 0.4)
3. Use validate_feature() only, skip spatial filtering
4. Filter only specific regions (e.g., near tile boundaries)

### Problem: Slow performance

**Solutions:**

1. Process in chunks/tiles
2. Reduce k_neighbors (but maintain quality)
3. Downsample point cloud before filtering
4. Use spatial indexing (KD-tree reuse)

### Problem: High memory usage

**Solutions:**

1. Process features one at a time (not all at once)
2. Use chunked processing for large datasets
3. Delete intermediate arrays
4. Use float32 instead of float64

## Migration Guide

### From planarity_filter.py (v3.0.6)

The new `feature_filter.py` module is a drop-in replacement:

```python
# OLD (v3.0.6)
from ign_lidar.features.compute.planarity_filter import (
    smooth_planarity_spatial,
    validate_planarity,
)

# NEW (v3.1.0) - same API, more features
from ign_lidar.features.compute.feature_filter import (
    smooth_planarity_spatial,  # Same function signature
    validate_planarity,         # Same function signature
    smooth_linearity_spatial,   # NEW
    smooth_horizontality_spatial,  # NEW
    smooth_feature_spatial,     # NEW (generic)
)
```

**Backward Compatibility:** Fully compatible - no code changes needed.

### Deprecated Imports

```python
# These still work but emit deprecation warnings
from ign_lidar.features.compute.planarity_filter import *
```

**Action:** Update imports to use `feature_filter` module.
