# Architectural Features Integration - Summary

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Purpose**: Integrate canonical architectural features into classification for ASPRS, LOD2, and LOD3 modes

## Overview

This update integrates the canonical architectural feature computation module (`ign_lidar/features/core/architectural.py`) into all three classification modes (ASPRS, LOD2, LOD3) to provide consistent, high-quality building detection features.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Updates

#### ASPRS Configuration (`config_asprs_preprocessing.yaml`)

```yaml
features:
  mode: asprs
  compute_planarity: true # Required for architectural features

  # Architectural features for building classification
  compute_architectural_features: true
  compute_verticality: true
  compute_horizontality: true
  compute_wall_likelihood: true
  compute_roof_likelihood: true
  compute_facade_score: true
```

**Why**: ASPRS mode focuses on basic class separation (ground, buildings, vegetation, roads). Architectural features help distinguish buildings from other classes.

#### LOD2 Configuration (`config_lod2_preprocessing.yaml`)

```yaml
features:
  mode: lod2

  # Architectural features (essential for LOD2 wall/roof classification)
  compute_architectural_features: true
  compute_horizontality: true
  compute_wall_likelihood: true
  compute_roof_likelihood: true
  compute_facade_score: true
  compute_building_regularity: true
  compute_corner_likelihood: true
```

**Why**: LOD2 requires detailed wall/roof separation for building reconstruction. The canonical architectural features provide reliable wall/roof likelihood scores.

#### LOD3 Configuration (`config_lod3_preprocessing.yaml`)

```yaml
features:
  mode: lod3

  # Full architectural features suite (essential for LOD3 classification)
  compute_architectural_features: true
  compute_horizontality: true
  compute_wall_likelihood: true
  compute_roof_likelihood: true
  compute_facade_score: true
  compute_building_regularity: true
  compute_corner_likelihood: true
```

**Why**: LOD3 requires maximum detail for architectural elements (windows, doors, balconies). Full architectural feature suite enables fine-grained classification.

### 2. Code Updates

#### GPU Feature Computer (`ign_lidar/features/features_gpu.py`)

**Before**:

```python
from .features import compute_architectural_features
architectural_features = compute_architectural_features(
    eigenvalues, normals, points, tree, k
)
```

**After**:

```python
from .core.architectural import compute_architectural_features as compute_arch_features_core
architectural_features = compute_arch_features_core(
    points=points,
    normals=normals,
    eigenvalues=eigenvalues
)
```

**Why**: Use canonical implementation with cleaner API (no KDTree dependency).

#### CPU Feature Computer (`ign_lidar/features/features.py`)

**Before**:

```python
architectural_features = compute_architectural_features(
    eigenvalues_sorted, normals, points, tree, k
)
```

**After**:

```python
from .core.architectural import compute_architectural_features as compute_arch_core
architectural_features = compute_arch_core(
    points=points,
    normals=normals,
    eigenvalues=eigenvalues_sorted
)
# Keep legacy features with prefix for backward compatibility
legacy_architectural = compute_architectural_features(...)
for key, value in legacy_architectural.items():
    geo_features[f'legacy_{key}'] = value
```

**Why**: Use canonical features as primary, keep legacy features for backward compatibility.

### 3. Feature Mode Updates (`feature_modes.py`)

#### LOD2 Features

**Added**:

- `wall_likelihood` - Canonical wall probability
- `roof_likelihood` - Canonical roof probability
- `facade_score` - Facade detection score
- `horizontality` - Horizontal surface detection

**Total**: 19 features (was 17)

#### LOD3 Features

**Added**:

- `wall_likelihood` - Canonical wall probability
- `roof_likelihood` - Canonical roof probability
- `facade_score` - Facade detection score
- `horizontality` - Horizontal surface detection
- Legacy features with `legacy_` prefix

**Total**: ~45 features (was 43)

#### ASPRS Features

**Added**:

- `wall_likelihood` - Canonical wall probability
- `roof_likelihood` - Canonical roof probability
- `facade_score` - Facade detection score
- `horizontality` - Horizontal surface detection

**Total**: ~33 features (was 30)

### 4. Feature Descriptions

Added canonical architectural feature descriptions:

```python
'horizontality': 'Horizontality score [0,1] - 1 for horizontal surfaces',
'wall_likelihood': 'Wall probability (canonical from architectural.py)',
'roof_likelihood': 'Roof probability (canonical from architectural.py)',
'facade_score': 'Facade characteristic score (verticality + height + planarity)',
```

## Canonical Architectural Features

The canonical architectural module (`architectural.py`) provides:

### Core Features

1. **`verticality`**: Measures vertical alignment (0 = horizontal, 1 = vertical)

   - Used for wall detection
   - Formula: `1 - |dot(normal, [0,0,1])|`

2. **`horizontality`**: Measures horizontal alignment (0 = vertical, 1 = horizontal)

   - Used for roof/ground detection
   - Formula: `|dot(normal, [0,0,1])|`

3. **`planarity`**: Measures surface flatness

   - Formula: `(λ2 - λ3) / λ1`
   - Essential for building surfaces

4. **`wall_likelihood`**: Combined wall probability

   - Formula: `sqrt(verticality × planarity)`
   - High for planar vertical surfaces

5. **`roof_likelihood`**: Combined roof probability

   - Formula: `sqrt(horizontality × planarity)`
   - High for planar horizontal surfaces

6. **`facade_score`**: Facade characteristic score
   - Combines verticality with height above ground
   - Identifies facade elements

### Additional Features (LOD2/LOD3)

7. **`building_regularity`**: Regular structure score

   - Combines planarity with low sphericity
   - Identifies structured building geometry

8. **`corner_likelihood`**: Edge/corner detection
   - Based on eigenvalue linearity
   - High at building corners and edges

## Benefits

### 1. Consistency

- Same architectural features across all modes
- Canonical implementation reduces code duplication
- Clear feature definitions

### 2. Quality

- Well-tested formulas from published research
- Numerically stable implementations
- Proper handling of edge cases

### 3. Performance

- No KDTree dependency for core features
- Efficient NumPy operations
- GPU-compatible (if needed in future)

### 4. Maintainability

- Single source of truth for architectural features
- Easy to update and improve
- Clear documentation

## Usage Examples

### ASPRS Classification

```python
# Preprocess with architectural features
ign-lidar-hd process --config config_asprs_preprocessing.yaml

# Features available for classification:
# - wall_likelihood: Separates walls from other vertical features
# - roof_likelihood: Separates roofs from ground
# - facade_score: Identifies building facades
```

### LOD2 Building Reconstruction

```python
# Preprocess with enhanced architectural features
ign-lidar-hd process --config config_lod2_preprocessing.yaml

# Features available:
# - wall_likelihood: Identifies wall segments
# - roof_likelihood: Identifies roof surfaces
# - facade_score: Identifies facade planes
# - building_regularity: Validates building structure
```

### LOD3 Detailed Modeling

```python
# Preprocess with full architectural feature suite
ign-lidar-hd process --config config_lod3_preprocessing.yaml

# Features available:
# - All canonical architectural features
# - Legacy features (with prefix) for backward compatibility
# - Building regularity and corner detection
```

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Code

- Legacy features are preserved with `legacy_` prefix
- Existing models can continue using `wall_score` and `roof_score`
- New models should use `wall_likelihood` and `roof_likelihood`

### For New Development

- Use canonical features from `architectural.py`
- Follow naming conventions: `*_likelihood` for probabilities
- Document feature dependencies (e.g., requires normals + eigenvalues)

## Testing

To verify architectural features are computed correctly:

```bash
# Run preprocessing for each mode
ign-lidar-hd process --config config_asprs_preprocessing.yaml
ign-lidar-hd process --config config_lod2_preprocessing.yaml
ign-lidar-hd process --config config_lod3_preprocessing.yaml

# Verify features in output LAZ files
python scripts/analyze_npz_detailed.py --input /path/to/enriched.laz

# Check for canonical features:
# - wall_likelihood
# - roof_likelihood
# - facade_score
# - horizontality
```

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Architectural features use existing normals and eigenvalues
- **No additional KDTree queries**: Direct computation from available data
- **Vectorized operations**: Efficient NumPy implementation
- **Memory efficient**: In-place operations where possible

## Future Enhancements

1. **GPU Acceleration**: Move architectural features to GPU for large datasets
2. **Advanced Features**: Add opening detection, material classification
3. **Multi-scale**: Compute features at multiple scales for robustness
4. **Uncertainty**: Add confidence scores for feature predictions
