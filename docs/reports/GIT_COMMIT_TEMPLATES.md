## Task 1.1: Fix Duplicate Function Bug

```
fix: Rename duplicate compute_verticality to compute_normal_verticality

- Resolves duplicate function definition at line 877 in features.py
- Clarifies intent: eigenvalue-based vs normal-based verticality
- Maintains backward compatibility with deprecation warning
- Adds comprehensive docstrings to both functions

Fixes critical bug identified in PACKAGE_AUDIT_REPORT.md
Issue: Python silently overwrites first definition with second

Before: 2 functions named compute_verticality (lines 440, 877)
After: compute_verticality (line 440) + compute_normal_verticality (line 877)

Breaking changes: None (both methods still callable)
```

## Tips for Good Commit Messages

### Structure

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code restructuring (no functional change)
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, version bumps

### Best Practices

1. **First line**: Short (50 chars), imperative mood ("Add" not "Added")
2. **Body**: Wrap at 72 chars, explain what and why
3. **Footer**: Reference issues, breaking changes
4. **Be specific**: Include metrics (LOC reduced, coverage gained)
5. **Link to docs**: Reference implementation guides
