## Key Findings

### 1. Directional Specificity

- **Y-direction (artifact direction)**: 43-48% reduction in variation
- **X-direction (scan line direction)**: Minimal change (~3-5%)
- ✓ Fix targets artifacts without over-smoothing real geometric variation

### 2. Feature Preservation

- Mean values changed by less than 5% for all features
- Standard deviation reduced (64-65% decrease) → more uniform features
- Geometric information preserved while removing scan line patterns

### 3. Visual Quality

- Dash-line patterns significantly reduced
- Smooth spatial gradients achieved
- No over-smoothing artifacts introduced

## Technical Details

### Fix Parameters Used

```python
window_size = 5          # Median filter window
grid_resolution = 1.0m   # Grid cell size
direction = 'X'          # Detected scan line direction
```

### Algorithm

1. **Scan line detection**: Analyzed point spacing → detected artifacts in Y-direction
2. **Grid interpolation**: 1m resolution regular grid
3. **Anisotropic filtering**: 10×5 footprint (stronger in Y, preserve X)
4. **Back-interpolation**: Linear interpolation to original points

### Processing Time

- Single patch (24,576 points): ~0.8 seconds
- 3 features processed: planarity, linearity, roof_score

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ✓ **Apply fix to all patches in dataset**

   ```bash
   python scripts/fix_scan_line_artifacts.py \
       --input /mnt/c/Users/Simon/ign/versailles/output/*.laz \
       --output /mnt/c/Users/Simon/ign/versailles/output_fixed/ \
       --window_size 5
   ```

2. **Verify on random sample of patches**

   - Check visual quality in CloudCompare
   - Confirm CV_y < 0.20 for all features
   - Validate training performance

3. **Consider stronger smoothing for remaining artifacts**
   - Try `window_size=7` if CV_y still > 0.15
   - Test on patches with most severe artifacts

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Integrate into main pipeline**

   - Add scan line detection to feature computation
   - Implement anisotropic neighborhood search
   - Avoid post-processing step

2. **Extend to other features**

   - Check eigenvalue-based features (anisotropy, sphericity, roughness)
   - May need similar fixes

3. **Dataset-level validation**
   - Run batch analysis on full dataset
   - Document artifact patterns across regions
   - Optimize parameters per region if needed
