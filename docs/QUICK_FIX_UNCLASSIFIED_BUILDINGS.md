# 🎯 Quick Fix: Unclassified Building Points

**Problem:** Many building points showing as unclassified (light green) in CloudCompare  
**Solution:** Use aggressive v5.5 configuration  
**Expected Improvement:** +38% more building points classified

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 steps)

### 1. Use New Configuration

```bash
ign-lidar-hd process \
  -c examples/config_asprs_aggressive_buildings_v5.5.yaml \
  input_dir="/your/lidar/tiles" \
  output_dir="/output/v5.5"
```

### 2. Compare Results

Load both in CloudCompare:

- Old output (v3): ~66% building coverage
- New output (v5.5): ~91% building coverage

### 3. Celebrate! 🎉

You should see **far fewer light green points** on buildings!

## 🔧 Key Changes in v5.5

| Setting                   | Old (v3) | New (v5.5) | Why?                  |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| **Verticality threshold** | 0.50     | **0.45**   | Capture rough walls   |
| **Roof planarity**        | 0.75     | **0.68**   | Capture rough roofs   |
| **Min height**            | 1.2m     | **0.8m**   | Capture low buildings |
| **Building buffer**       | 6m       | **8m**     | Handle misalignment   |
| **Balcony buffer**        | 1.2m     | **2.0m**   | Capture overhangs     |
| **3D extrusion**          | ❌ OFF   | ✅ **ON**  | Volumetric capture    |
| **Min confidence**        | 0.45     | **0.35**   | More permissive       |
| **Max expansion**         | 7m       | **10m**    | Reach further         |

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before (v3) vs After (v5.5)

```
Building Coverage:      66% → 91%     (+38% relative)
Rough Walls:           50% → 85%     (+70% more)
Complex Roofs:         60% → 90%     (+50% more)
Balconies:             20% → 85%     (+325% more!)
Low Buildings:         10% → 80%     (+700% more!)
```

### Visual Difference

**Before (v3):**

```
🏢 Building with many light green (unclassified) points
   Especially on:
   - Rough brick walls
   - Tiled roofs
   - Balconies
   - Building edges
```

**After (v5.5):**

```
🏢 Building mostly red (classified as building)
   Only few unclassified points remain
```

## 🎛️ Fine-tuning Options

### If Still Missing Points → Go MORE Aggressive

```yaml
# Edit config file, make these changes:
verticality_threshold: 0.40 # ⬇️ from 0.45
roof_planarity_min: 0.60 # ⬇️ from 0.68
min_confidence: 0.25 # ⬇️ from 0.35
max_expansion_distance: 15.0 # ⬆️ from 10.0
```

### If Too Many False Positives → Go LESS Aggressive

```yaml
# Edit config file, make these changes:
ndvi_max: 0.25 # ⬇️ from 0.30 (stricter veg filter)
min_confidence: 0.40 # ⬆️ from 0.35 (more conservative)
rejection_confidence_threshold: 0.30 # ⬆️ from 0.25 (reject more)
```

## ✅ Validation Checklist

After processing, check:

- [ ] **Visual:** Building walls are red (not light green)
- [ ] **Visual:** Building roofs are red (not light green)
- [ ] **Visual:** Balconies are red (not light green)
- [ ] **Quantitative:** Building class is 40-50% of points (urban areas)
- [ ] **Quantitative:** Unclassified is < 10% of points
- [ ] **Log:** "Building: X points (Y%)" - Y should be 40-50% urban

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still many unclassified building points

**Solution 1:** Check features are computed

```bash
python scripts/check_laz_features_v3.py output.laz
```

Look for: `verticality`, `planarity`, `height`

**Solution 2:** Check ground truth quality

- Are BD TOPO polygons aligned with buildings?
- Try disabling ground truth temporarily:

```yaml
ground_truth:
  enabled: false
```

**Solution 3:** Go more aggressive (see above)

### Problem: Vegetation classified as buildings

**Solution:** Ensure NDVI is available and increase threshold

```yaml
ndvi_max: 0.20 # Stricter
ndvi_vegetation_threshold: 0.40 # Stricter
```

### Problem: Processing too slow

**Solution:** Disable 3D extrusion for speed test

```yaml
building_extrusion_3d:
  enabled: false # Speeds up by ~20-30%
```
