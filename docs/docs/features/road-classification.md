# 🛣️ Road & Railway Classification

:::tip Version & Status
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 2025  
**Status:** Production Ready ✅
:::

## Overview

The **Road & Railway Classification** system provides robust detection of transportation infrastructure using multi-criteria filtering. Unlike simple polygon-based classification, this system combines **spectral**, **geometric**, and **spatial** features to accurately distinguish roads and railways from vegetation and adjacent buildings.

### Key Capabilities

✅ **Multi-criteria filtering** - NDVI, curvature, verticality, height, planarity  
✅ **Vegetation exclusion** - NDVI threshold prevents tree/grass confusion  
✅ **Building protection** - Vertical structures automatically excluded  
✅ **Ground-referenced height** - RGE ALTI DTM integration for accurate elevation  
✅ **Bridge/tunnel detection** - Height-based identification of elevated/underground infrastructure  
✅ **Classification protection** - Preserves existing building/vegetation labels

## Problems Solved

### Before Improvements

**❌ Vegetation Misclassified as Roads:**

- Trees along road edges incorrectly classified as road surface
- **Cause:** BD TOPO road polygons sometimes include roadside trees
- **Impact:** Road class contaminated with high NDVI, complex curvature points

**❌ Buildings Misclassified as Roads:**

- Vertical building elements adjacent to roads classified as road
- **Cause:** BD TOPO road polygon buffers overlapped buildings
- **Impact:** Vertical points with low planarity included in roads

**❌ Elevated Structures Confused:**

- Overpasses, bridges mixed with ground-level roads
- **Cause:** No height-based separation
- **Impact:** Unable to distinguish bridge from road below

### After Improvements

**✅ Vegetation Correctly Excluded:**

- NDVI filter removes all photosynthetically active points
- Curvature filter excludes complex foliage surfaces
- Trees, grass, bushes properly classified as vegetation

**✅ Buildings Protected:**

- Verticality filter excludes vertical walls
- Existing building classifications preserved
- Clean separation between roads and adjacent structures

**✅ Transportation Infrastructure Isolated:**

- Only horizontal, planar, ground-level surfaces classified as roads/railways
- Bridges, overpasses, tunnels correctly identified
- Multi-level transportation properly separated

    J -->|Roughness < 0.05| K
    J -->|Intensity 0.15-0.7| K
```

### 1. NDVI Vegetation Filter

**Principle:** Vegetation has high NDVI due to chlorophyll reflectance

**Implementation:**

```python
# Vegetation exclusion by NDVI
if ndvi is not None:
    vegetation_ndvi_mask = ndvi > config.ROAD_NDVI_MAX  # 0.20
    filtered_road_mask = filtered_road_mask & ~vegetation_ndvi_mask
```

**Threshold:** `ROAD_NDVI_MAX = 0.20`

**Justification:**

- NDVI > 0.20 indicates photosynthetic activity (vegetation)
- Road surfaces (asphalt, concrete) have NDVI < 0.15
- 0.05 safety margin to avoid false positives

**Examples:**

| Surface Type | Typical NDVI | Classified As            |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Asphalt road | 0.05-0.12    | Road ✓                   |
| Concrete     | 0.08-0.15    | Road ✓                   |
| Grass        | 0.30-0.60    | Vegetation (excluded)    |
| Trees        | 0.40-0.80    | Vegetation (excluded)    |
| Bare soil    | 0.10-0.25    | Road/Ground (borderline) |

### 2. Surface Curvature Filter

**Principle:** Roads are planar surfaces; vegetation has complex curvature

**Implementation:**

```python
# Exclude complex surfaces (foliage, branches)
if curvature is not None:
    vegetation_curve_mask = curvature > config.ROAD_CURVATURE_MAX  # 0.05
    filtered_road_mask = filtered_road_mask & ~vegetation_curve_mask
```

**Threshold:** `ROAD_CURVATURE_MAX = 0.05`

**Justification:**

- Roads = planar surfaces, low curvature (< 0.05)
- Vegetation = complex surfaces, high curvature (> 0.05)
- Distinguishes tree foliage from flat pavement

**Examples:**

| Surface Type  | Typical Curvature | Classified As         |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Flat road     | 0.005-0.020       | Road ✓                |
| Curved road   | 0.020-0.040       | Road ✓                |
| Tree canopy   | 0.15-0.40         | Vegetation (excluded) |
| Building edge | 0.10-0.30         | Building (excluded)   |

### 3. Verticality Filter

**Principle:** Roads are horizontal; building walls are vertical

**Implementation:**

```python
# Exclude vertical structures (walls, poles)
if verticality is not None:
    building_vertical_mask = verticality > config.ROAD_VERTICALITY_MAX  # 0.30
    filtered_road_mask = filtered_road_mask & ~building_vertical_mask
```

**Threshold:** `ROAD_VERTICALITY_MAX = 0.30`

**Justification:**

- Roads = horizontal surfaces, verticality < 0.30
- Building walls = vertical surfaces, verticality > 0.70
- Threshold at 0.30 filters inclined structures

**Examples:**

| Structure Type | Typical Verticality | Classified As       |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Flat road      | 0.02-0.10           | Road ✓              |
| Sloped road    | 0.15-0.25           | Road ✓              |
| Building wall  | 0.75-0.95           | Building (excluded) |
| Utility pole   | 0.90-0.98           | Object (excluded)   |

### 4. Height Filter (Ground-Referenced)

**Principle:** Roads are at ground level; elevated points are not roads

**Implementation:**

```python
# Points above 0.3m are not road surfaces
elevated_mask = height > config.ROAD_HEIGHT_MAX  # 0.3m
filtered_road_mask = filtered_road_mask & ~elevated_mask
```

**Threshold Changes:**

| Parameter         | Old Value | **New Value** | Justification                      |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `ROAD_HEIGHT_MAX` | 1.5m      | **0.3m**      | Strict ground-level classification |
| `ROAD_HEIGHT_MIN` | N/A       | **-0.5m**     | Allow depressions, exclude tunnels |

**Justification:**

- Ground-level roads: height < 0.3m (strict ground-level)
- Tree canopy: height > 3.0m
- Low buildings: height > 2.5m
- Threshold at 0.3m ensures only true ground surfaces

**Examples:**

| Feature Type    | Typical Height | Classified As         |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| Road surface    | -0.2 to +0.3m  | Road ✓                |
| Roadside tree   | 3.0-15.0m      | Vegetation (excluded) |
| Bridge/overpass | 4.0-10.0m      | Bridge (special)      |
| Tunnel          | -2.0 to -5.0m  | Tunnel (special)      |

### 5. Planarity Filter (Enhanced)

**Principle:** Roads must be very planar surfaces

**Implementation:**

```python
# Roads must be very planar
road_candidates = (
    (planarity > config.PLANARITY_ROAD_MIN) &  # 0.7
    # ... other criteria
)
```

**Threshold Changes:**

| Parameter            | Old Value | **New Value** | Justification                    |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `ROAD_PLANARITY_MIN` | 0.6       | **0.7**       | More selective for flat surfaces |

**Justification:**

- Paved/asphalt roads are very planar (planarity > 0.8)
- Vegetation has low planarity (< 0.4)
- Threshold at 0.7 filters irregular surfaces

### 6. Classification Protection

**Principle:** Preserve accurate prior classifications

**Implementation:**

```python
# Protect points already classified as buildings or vegetation
protected_mask = np.isin(labels, [LOD2_WALL, LOD2_VEG_LOW, LOD2_VEG_HIGH])
filtered_road_mask = filtered_road_mask & ~protected_mask
```

**Benefits:**

- Avoids reclassifying already-identified buildings/vegetation
- Preserves consistency between classification stages
- Priority to precise geometric classifications

---

## Ground-Referenced Height Classification

### RGE ALTI Integration

The system uses **RGE ALTI® DTM** (Digital Terrain Model) for accurate height above ground computation:

```python
from ign_lidar.io.rge_alti_fetcher import RGEALTIFetcher

# Compute ground-referenced height
fetcher = RGEALTIFetcher(cache_dir="/data/cache", resolution=1.0)
height_above_ground = fetcher.compute_height_above_ground(points, bbox)

# Use for classification
road_mask = (
    (height_above_ground >= -0.5) &  # Allow slight depression
    (height_above_ground <= 1.5) &  # Ground level only
    (planarity > 0.7) &
    (ndvi < 0.20)
)
```

### Bridge Detection

**Elevated road points (>2.0m above ground) within road polygons = bridge:**

```python
is_bridge = (height_above_ground > 2.0) & in_road_polygon
# Classify as bridge infrastructure (special code)
```

### Tunnel Detection

**Underground road points (&lt;-0.5m below ground) = tunnel/underpass:**

```python
is_tunnel = (height_above_ground < -0.5) & in_road_polygon
# Classify as tunnel infrastructure (special code)
```

### Configuration

```yaml
classification:
  road_height_min: -0.5 # Allow depressions
  road_height_max: 0.3 # Ground level only (strict)
  bridge_height_min: 2.0 # Bridge detection threshold
  tunnel_height_max: -0.5 # Tunnel detection threshold

rge_alti:
  enabled: true
  cache_dir: /data/rge_alti_cache
  resolution: 1.0 # 1m resolution
  use_wcs: true
```

---

## Railway Classification

Railway classification uses similar criteria with railway-specific thresholds:

### Railway Thresholds

```python
# Railway-specific thresholds (similar to roads but slightly relaxed)
RAIL_HEIGHT_MIN = -0.5
RAIL_HEIGHT_MAX = 2.0
RAIL_PLANARITY_MIN = 0.65  # Slightly lower than roads (ballast)
RAIL_NDVI_MAX = 0.25       # Allow more vegetation (grass between tracks)
```

### Railway Features

**Ballast Detection:**

- Lower planarity due to gravel/stones (0.65 vs 0.70 for roads)
- Higher roughness acceptable (0.08 vs 0.05)
- Distinctive intensity pattern from rails

**Vegetation Tolerance:**

- Grass often grows between tracks
- NDVI threshold slightly higher (0.25 vs 0.20)
- Curvature filter still applied (< 0.05)

### Configuration

```yaml
classification:
  # Railway thresholds
  rail_height_min: -0.5
  rail_height_max: 2.0
  rail_planarity_min: 0.65
  rail_ndvi_max: 0.25
  rail_curvature_max: 0.05
  rail_verticality_max: 0.30
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Roads Still Contain Vegetation

**Symptoms:** Trees or grass classified as road

**Possible Causes:**

- NDVI not computed or incorrect
- NDVI threshold too high
- Colors not available in LAZ

**Solutions:**

```yaml
# Ensure NDVI is computed
classification:
  use_ndvi: true
  road_ndvi_max: 0.18 # Lower threshold (was 0.20)

# Verify colors exist
input:
  require_colors: true # Fail if no RGB
```

### Issue 2: Missing Road Sections

**Symptoms:** Valid road surfaces not classified

**Possible Causes:**

- Thresholds too strict
- Ground truth polygons missing
- Height computation issues

**Solutions:**

```yaml
# Relax thresholds slightly
classification:
  road_planarity_min: 0.65 # Lower (was 0.70)
  road_height_max: 0.5 # Higher (was 0.3, but still ground-level)
  road_ndvi_max: 0.22 # Higher (was 0.20)
```

### Issue 3: Bridges Not Separated

**Symptoms:** Bridge and road below mixed

**Possible Causes:**

- RGE ALTI not enabled
- Bridge detection disabled
- Insufficient height separation

**Solutions:**

```yaml
# Enable proper bridge detection
rge_alti:
  enabled: true # Must be true!

classification:
  bridge_height_min: 2.0
  enable_bridge_detection: true
```

### Issue 4: Buildings Still Misclassified

**Symptoms:** Vertical walls classified as road

**Possible Causes:**

- Verticality not computed
- Classification protection disabled

**Solutions:**

```yaml
# Ensure protection enabled
classification:
  protect_existing_classifications: true
  road_verticality_max: 0.25 # Lower (was 0.30)

# Compute verticality
processing:
  compute_verticality: true
```

## Best Practices

### Recommendations

1. **Always compute NDVI** when spectral bands available
2. **Use multiple criteria** for robustness (NDVI + curvature + verticality)
3. **Protect existing classifications** to avoid conflicts
4. **Adjust thresholds** based on context (urban vs rural)
5. **Validate visually** results on test zones

### Known Limitations

**Shaded Roads:**

- May have slightly higher NDVI (shadows)
- Solution: Relax NDVI threshold to 0.22

**Very Worn Roads:**

- May have higher roughness
- Solution: Increase roughness_max to 0.08

**Bridges:**

- Require special handling (elevation)
- Solution: Enable bridge detection with RGE ALTI

**Tunnels:**

- No NDVI available (no light)
- Solution: Rely on height and planarity only

---

## Filter Priority Order

The filters are applied in this order for optimal results:

1. **Classification Protection** - Preserve existing building/vegetation labels
2. **NDVI Filter** - Direct spectral indicator of vegetation
3. **Curvature Filter** - Surface complexity (foliage vs pavement)
4. **Verticality Filter** - Orientation (horizontal vs vertical)
5. **Height Filter** - Elevation (ground-level vs structures)
6. **Geometric Validation** - Planarity, roughness, intensity

This order ensures:

- Protected classifications are never modified
- Spectral evidence (NDVI) has highest priority
- Geometric constraints applied last for fine-tuning
