## üöÄ Basic Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare ASPRS-Classified Data

```bash
# Start with ASPRS-classified tiles
# (See ASPRS Classification Example)

mkdir -p ~/lod2_tutorial
cd ~/lod2_tutorial

# Use ASPRS-classified data as input
cp ../asprs_tutorial/data/output/*.laz data/input/
```

### Step 2: Apply LOD2 Classification

```bash
# Process with LOD2 classification
ign-lidar-hd process \
  --config-name config_lod2 \
  input_dir=data/input/ \
  output_dir=data/output/

# Output files with LOD2 classes:
# data/output/
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tile_0650_6860_lod2.laz
# ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tile_0651_6860_lod2.laz
```

### Step 3: Verify LOD2 Classes

```python
import laspy
import numpy as np

    """Verify LOD2 classification."""

    las = laspy.read(laz_path)

    print(f"\nBuilding Analysis:")
    print(f"  Total building points: {building_points:,} ({building_pct:.2f}%)")

    # Roof type distribution
    roof_classes = [3, 4, 5]
    roof_counts = counts[np.isin(classes, roof_classes)]
    if len(roof_counts) > 0:
        print(f"  Roof types detected: {len(roof_counts)}")

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: No Roof Types Detected

**Symptom**: All roofs classified as flat (Class 3)

**Solutions**:

```yaml
features:
  compute_curvature: true # Required for roof type detection
  compute_planarity: true # Required for flat detection

classification:
  building_components:
    roof_detection:
      enabled: true
      min_roof_area: 5.0 # Lower threshold
      methods: ["geometry", "planarity", "slope"]
```

### Issue 2: Buildings Not Extracted

**Symptom**: No building components found

**Solutions**:

1. Check ASPRS input has Class 6 (Building)
2. Verify BD TOPO ground truth
3. Lower extraction thresholds

```yaml
classification:
  building_components:
    min_building_points: 50 # Lower threshold
    min_building_area: 10.0 # Lower area threshold
```

### Issue 3: Floor Detection Fails

**Symptom**: No floors detected in multi-story buildings

**Solutions**:

```yaml
features:
  building_features:
    detect_floors: true
    floor_height: 3.0 # Typical floor height
    min_floor_points: 100 # Minimum points per floor
```
