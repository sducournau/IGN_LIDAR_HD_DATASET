## 🔴 Critical Bug Fix

### BD TOPO Reclassification Priority Issue

**Severity:** Critical 🔴  
**Impact:** Buildings being overwritten by roads in overlapping areas  
**Affected Versions:** All versions prior to v3.3.4  
**Fix Location:** `ign_lidar/core/classification/reclassifier.py`

#### The Problem

A double reversal of priority order in the reclassification logic caused roads to incorrectly overwrite buildings in areas where building and road polygons overlapped (e.g., building entrances, driveways, covered parking).

**Expected behavior:**

```
Buildings (Priority 1) > Roads (Priority 2)
→ Buildings should overwrite roads
```

**Actual behavior (bug):**

```
Roads overwriting Buildings
→ 20-30% classification accuracy loss
```

#### The Root Cause

The code had two reversals:

1. `get_priority_order_for_iteration()` already returned reversed order
2. An additional `reversed()` call in the iteration loop

This caused a **double reversal** = original (incorrect) order:

```python
# BUG (before v3.3.4):
for layer_name in reversed(get_priority_order_for_iteration()):
    # Double reversal caused roads > buildings ❌
    ...

# FIX (v3.3.4):
for layer_name in get_priority_order_for_iteration():
    # Correct priority: buildings > roads ✅
    ...
```

#### The Impact

**Before Fix (v3.3.3 and earlier):**

- Roads overwrite buildings: **20-30% lower classification accuracy**
- Building entrances misclassified as roads
- Covered parking areas lost building label
- Driveways incorrectly extending into buildings

**After Fix (v3.3.4):**

- Buildings correctly overwrite roads: **+20-30% classification accuracy**
- Proper building boundary preservation
- Correct handling of building-road interfaces
- Accurate classification at entrances and driveways

#### Migration Notes

**No configuration changes required!** Simply upgrade:

```bash
pip install --upgrade ign-lidar-hd
```

If you have processed data with v3.3.3 or earlier and are using BD TOPO building classification, consider **reprocessing** your data to get correct results.

## ✨ Feature Enhancements

### Unified Feature Filtering System (from v3.1.0)

Version 3.3.4 builds upon the unified feature filtering framework introduced in v3.1.0, ensuring all geometric features benefit from consistent artifact removal.

**New Module:** `ign_lidar/features/compute/feature_filter.py`

#### Generic Filtering Functions

**Core Functions:**

- `smooth_feature_spatial()` - Generic spatial filtering for any feature
- `validate_feature()` - Generic NaN/Inf handling and outlier clipping

**Specialized Functions:**

- `smooth_planarity_spatial()` - Remove planarity artifacts
- `smooth_linearity_spatial()` - Remove linearity artifacts
- `smooth_horizontality_spatial()` - Remove horizontality artifacts
- `validate_planarity()` - Sanitize planarity values
- `validate_linearity()` - Sanitize linearity values
- `validate_horizontality()` - Sanitize horizontality values

#### Problems Solved

**Line/dash artifacts in three geometric features:**

1. **Planarity**: `(λ2 - λ3) / λ1`
   - Artifacts at planar surface edges (roof→ground transitions)
2. **Linearity**: `(λ1 - λ2) / λ1`
   - Artifacts at linear feature boundaries (edges, beams)
3. **Horizontality**: `|dot(normal, vertical)|`
   - Artifacts at horizontal surface edges (floors, ceilings)

**Root Cause:** k-NN neighborhoods crossing object boundaries:

- Wall → air transitions
- Roof → ground transitions
- Building → vegetation interfaces

**Solution:** Adaptive spatial filtering with variance detection:

- Detects artifacts: `std(neighbors) > threshold`
- Corrects: median of valid neighbors (robust to outliers)
- Preserves: normal regions unchanged

#### Benefits

- **Code Reduction:** ~60% less code through unified implementation
- **Consistency:** Same filtering logic for all geometric features
- **Backward Compatible:** All `planarity_filter.py` functions still work
- **Performance:** Same as v3.0.6 (~5-10s for 1M points with k=15)
- **Impact:**
  - Eliminates NaN/Inf warnings
  - Reduces 100-200+ artifacts per tile
  - Improves classification accuracy at boundaries

#### Usage Example

```python
from ign_lidar.features.compute import (
    smooth_feature_spatial,
    smooth_planarity_spatial,
    smooth_linearity_spatial,
    smooth_horizontality_spatial
)

# Generic filtering for any feature
smoothed, stats = smooth_feature_spatial(
    feature_values=my_feature,
    points=xyz_coords,
    k_neighbors=15,
    std_threshold=0.3
)

# Specific feature filtering
planarity_smooth, p_stats = smooth_planarity_spatial(
    planarity, points, k_neighbors=15
)

linearity_smooth, l_stats = smooth_linearity_spatial(
    linearity, points, k_neighbors=15
)

horizontality_smooth, h_stats = smooth_horizontality_spatial(
    horizontality, points, k_neighbors=15
)
```
