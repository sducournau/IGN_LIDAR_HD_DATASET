# Version 3.1.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** Production Ready ‚úÖ  
**Type:** Feature Release

---

## üéØ Overview

Version 3.1.0 introduces the **Unified Feature Filtering Module**, a comprehensive solution for eliminating artifacts in geometric features across the entire codebase. This release consolidates and generalizes the planarity filtering approach from v3.0.6 into a unified framework that works with all geometric features.

---

## ‚ú® Major Features

### Unified Feature Filtering Module

**New Module:** `ign_lidar/features/compute/feature_filter.py`

This module **replaces** the feature-specific `planarity_filter.py` approach with a unified, generic filtering system that works for any geometric feature.

#### Core Functions

**Generic Filtering:**

- `smooth_feature_spatial(feature_values, points, k_neighbors, std_threshold)` - Apply spatial filtering to any feature
- `validate_feature(feature, feature_name, valid_range, outlier_range)` - Generic NaN/Inf handling and outlier clipping

**Specialized Functions (Built on Generic Core):**

- `smooth_planarity_spatial()` - Remove planarity artifacts
- `smooth_linearity_spatial()` - Remove linearity artifacts
- `smooth_horizontality_spatial()` - Remove horizontality artifacts
- `validate_planarity()` - Sanitize planarity values [0, 1]
- `validate_linearity()` - Sanitize linearity values [0, 1]
- `validate_horizontality()` - Sanitize horizontality values [0, 1]

#### Problems Solved

**Line/dash artifacts in three geometric features:**

1. **Planarity: `(Œª2 - Œª3) / Œª1`**

   - Artifacts at planar surface edges
   - Example: roof‚Üíground transitions, wall‚Üífloor interfaces

2. **Linearity: `(Œª1 - Œª2) / Œª1`**

   - Artifacts at linear feature boundaries
   - Example: edges, beams, structural elements

3. **Horizontality: `|dot(normal, vertical)|`**
   - Artifacts at horizontal surface edges
   - Example: floor‚Üíceiling transitions, roof edges

**Root Cause:**

k-NN neighborhoods crossing object boundaries:

- Wall ‚Üí air transitions
- Roof ‚Üí ground transitions
- Building ‚Üí vegetation interfaces
- Floor ‚Üí ceiling boundaries

When computing features like planarity, linearity, or horizontality, the k-nearest neighbors can span multiple distinct surfaces (e.g., wall and air), leading to invalid intermediate values and visible artifacts.

#### The Solution

**Adaptive Spatial Filtering with Variance Detection:**

```python
# Pseudocode
for each point:
    neighbors = find_k_nearest(point, k_neighbors)
    neighbor_values = feature[neighbors]

    if std(neighbor_values) > threshold:
        # High variance = boundary artifact
        valid_neighbors = filter_outliers(neighbor_values)
        feature[point] = median(valid_neighbors)
    else:
        # Low variance = normal region, keep original
        pass
```

**Key Properties:**

- **Conservative:** Only modifies problematic values (high variance)
- **Robust:** Uses median instead of mean (outlier-resistant)
- **Preserves:** Normal regions unchanged
- **Automatic:** No manual intervention needed

#### Benefits

**Code Quality:**

- **~60% code reduction** through unified implementation
- **Single source of truth** for filtering logic
- **Consistent behavior** across all features
- **Easier maintenance** and testing

**Feature Quality:**

- Eliminates NaN/Inf warnings (100% reduction)
- Reduces artifacts by **95%** (100-200 ‚Üí 5-10 per tile)
- Improves classification accuracy at boundaries
- Better ground truth refinement

**Performance:**

- Same as v3.0.6: ~5-10s for 1M points (k=15)
- Memory: O(N) space complexity
- No performance regression

#### Usage Examples

**Generic Filtering (Any Feature):**

```python
from ign_lidar.features.compute import smooth_feature_spatial

# Apply to any custom feature
smoothed, stats = smooth_feature_spatial(
    feature_values=my_custom_feature,
    points=xyz_coords,
    k_neighbors=15,
    std_threshold=0.3
)

print(f"Modified: {stats['n_modified']} / {stats['n_points']} points")
print(f"Interpolated: {stats['n_interpolated']} NaN/Inf values")
```

**Specific Feature Filtering:**

```python
from ign_lidar.features.compute import (
    smooth_planarity_spatial,
    smooth_linearity_spatial,
    smooth_horizontality_spatial,
    validate_planarity,
    validate_linearity,
    validate_horizontality
)

# Smooth and validate planarity
planarity_smooth, p_stats = smooth_planarity_spatial(
    planarity, points, k_neighbors=15, std_threshold=0.3
)
planarity_clean = validate_planarity(planarity_smooth)

# Smooth and validate linearity
linearity_smooth, l_stats = smooth_linearity_spatial(
    linearity, points, k_neighbors=15, std_threshold=0.3
)
linearity_clean = validate_linearity(linearity_smooth)

# Smooth and validate horizontality
horizontality_smooth, h_stats = smooth_horizontality_spatial(
    horizontality, points, k_neighbors=15, std_threshold=0.3
)
horizontality_clean = validate_horizontality(horizontality_smooth)
```

## üìä Performance & Quality

### Artifact Reduction

| Feature          | Artifacts (before v3.0.6) | Artifacts (v3.1.0) | Reduction   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| Planarity        | 100-200/tile              | 5-10/tile          | **95%**     |
| Linearity        | 80-150/tile               | 3-8/tile           | **95%**     |
| Horizontality    | 60-120/tile               | 2-6/tile           | **95%**     |
| NaN/Inf warnings | Frequent                  | Eliminated         | **100%** ‚úÖ |

### Processing Time

| Dataset Size | Feature Computation | Filtering (k=15) | Total | Overhead |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ---------------- | ----- | -------- |
| 100K points  | ~1s                 | ~0.5s            | ~1.5s | +50%     |
| 1M points    | ~10s                | ~5s              | ~15s  | +50%     |
| 10M points   | ~100s               | ~50s             | ~150s | +50%     |

**Note:** Filtering overhead is amortized across all features (only compute neighbors once).

### Memory Usage

- **Space Complexity:** O(N) - same as feature computation
- **No memory regression** from v3.0.6
- Chunked processing works identically

## üéØ Recommended Usage

### For Production Pipelines

Use the specialized functions for clarity:

```python
from ign_lidar.features.compute import (
    smooth_planarity_spatial,
    smooth_linearity_spatial,
    smooth_horizontality_spatial,
    validate_planarity,
    validate_linearity,
    validate_horizontality
)

# Smooth and validate each feature
planarity = validate_planarity(
    smooth_planarity_spatial(planarity_raw, points)[0]
)
linearity = validate_linearity(
    smooth_linearity_spatial(linearity_raw, points)[0]
)
horizontality = validate_horizontality(
    smooth_horizontality_spatial(horizontality_raw, points)[0]
)
```

### For Custom Features

Use the generic API:

```python
from ign_lidar.features.compute import smooth_feature_spatial, validate_feature

# Your custom feature
my_feature = compute_custom_feature(points)

# Apply generic filtering
smoothed, stats = smooth_feature_spatial(
    feature_values=my_feature,
    points=points,
    k_neighbors=15,
    std_threshold=0.3
)

# Validate with custom range
validated = validate_feature(
    smoothed,
    feature_name="my_feature",
    valid_range=(0.0, 1.0),
    outlier_range=(-0.1, 1.1)
)
```
