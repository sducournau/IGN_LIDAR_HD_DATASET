title: v2.4.0 - Production-Ready Feature Validation
---

**Release Date:** October 12, 2025

**Tagline:** Enhanced Geometric Feature Validation - Production-Ready ML Stability

---

## 🎯 Overview

Version 2.4.0 focuses on **feature robustness and validation**, ensuring all geometric features are guaranteed within valid ranges [0, 1] for optimal ML model stability. This release eliminates numerical artifacts and ensures consistent feature computation across all processing paths.

---

## ✨ What's New

### Enhanced Geometric Feature Validation

- ✅ **Feature Robustness**: All geometric features now guaranteed within valid ranges [0, 1]
- ✅ **Eigenvalue Clamping**: Prevents negative eigenvalues from numerical artifacts
- ✅ **Density Normalization**: Capped at 1000 points/m³ for ML stability
- ✅ **Boundary Feature Parity**: Complete feature set across all computation paths
- ✅ **Formula Standardization**: Consistent λ₀ normalization (Weinmann et al.)
- ✅ **Zero Overhead**: Less than 1% performance impact from validation
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Eliminates out-of-range warnings in all scenarios

---

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Feature Computation Modules

All geometric feature computation modules now include:

1. **Eigenvalue Clamping**: `eigenvalues = np.maximum(eigenvalues, 0.0)`
2. **Result Validation**: `np.clip(feature, 0.0, 1.0)` on all geometric features
3. **Density Normalization**: `np.minimum(density / 1000.0, 1.0)` for stable scaling
4. **Consistent Formulas**: λ₀ normalization across CPU/GPU/boundary modules

### Affected Modules

- ✅ `features.py` - CPU radius-based features (loop version)
- ✅ `gpu_features.py` - GPU-accelerated computation
- ✅ `features_boundary.py` - Boundary-aware stitching
- ✅ All feature computation paths validated

## 📊 Feature Validation Guarantees

### Geometric Features [0, 1]

All shape descriptors guaranteed in range:

- **Linearity**: (λ₀ - λ₁) / λ₀ ∈ [0, 1]
- **Planarity**: (λ₁ - λ₂) / λ₀ ∈ [0, 1]
- **Sphericity**: λ₂ / λ₀ ∈ [0, 1]
- **Anisotropy**: (λ₀ - λ₂) / λ₀ ∈ [0, 1]
- **Roughness**: λ₂ / Σλ ∈ [0, 1]
- **Omnivariance**: (λ₀ × λ₁ × λ₂)^(1/3) / λ₀ ∈ [0, 1]
- **Eigenentropy**: -Σ(pᵢ log pᵢ) / log(3) ∈ [0, 1]

### Density Features

- **Density**: `min(density / 1000.0, 1.0)` - capped at 1000 pts/m³
- **Prevents extreme outliers** in dense point clouds

## 🎓 Best Practices

### For ML Training

```python
# v2.4.0 guarantees all features in [0, 1]
# No need for custom normalization!

from ign_lidar import LiDARProcessor

processor = LiDARProcessor(
    lod_level="LOD3",
    use_gpu=True
)

# Features are already validated and normalized
patches = processor.process_tile("input.laz", "output/")
```

### For Production Deployment

```yaml
processor:
  use_gpu: true

features:
  mode: lod3
  k_neighbors: 30
  # All features automatically validated ✅
```
