# Ground Truth Refinement Guide

## Overview

The Ground Truth Refinement module (v5.2+) improves classification accuracy by validating and refining ground truth labels using geometric and spectral features.

**Version:** 5.2.0  
**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Production Ready

## Problem Statement

Traditional ground truth classification has several issues:

### 1. Water & Roads - Misclassification Issues

- **Problem:** Ground truth polygons may include elevated points (bridges, overpasses)
- **Solution:** Validate that water/road points are on flat, horizontal ground surfaces
- **Features Used:** Height, planarity, curvature, normals, NDVI

### 2. Vegetation - Poor Segmentation

- **Problem:** Single NDVI threshold doesn't capture all vegetation types
- **Solution:** Multi-feature vegetation confidence using NDVI + curvature + planarity
- **Features Used:** NDVI, curvature, planarity, height

### 3. Buildings - Polygon Misalignment

- **Problem:** Building polygons don't exactly match point cloud, leaving unclassified points
- **Solution:** Expand building polygons and validate with geometric features
- **Features Used:** Height, planarity, verticality, NDVI

## How It Works

### Refinement Steps

#### Step 1: Water Refinement

Validates water points are on flat, horizontal surfaces:

```python
Water Validation Criteria:
  ✓ Height: -0.5m to 0.3m (near ground)
  ✓ Planarity: ≥ 0.90 (very flat)
  ✓ Curvature: ≤ 0.02 (smooth)
  ✓ Normal Z: ≥ 0.95 (horizontal)
```

**Example:**

- **Before:** Bridge over water classified as water (elevated points)
- **After:** Only actual water surface classified as water

#### Step 2: Road Refinement

Validates road points are on flat, horizontal surfaces:

```python
Road Validation Criteria:
  ✓ Height: -0.5m to 2.0m (near ground)
  ✓ Planarity: ≥ 0.85 (very flat)
  ✓ Curvature: ≤ 0.05 (smooth)
  ✓ Normal Z: ≥ 0.90 (horizontal)
  ✓ NDVI: ≤ 0.15 (not vegetation)

Tree Canopy Detection:
  - Height > 2.0m + NDVI > 0.25 → Reclassify as vegetation
```

**Example:**

- **Before:** Tree canopy over road classified as road
- **After:** Road surface = road, tree canopy = vegetation

#### Step 3: Vegetation Refinement

Multi-feature vegetation confidence scoring:

```python
Vegetation Confidence Score:
  NDVI contribution:     0.5 × normalized_ndvi
  Curvature contribution: 0.25 × normalized_curvature
  Planarity contribution: 0.25 × (1 - normalized_planarity)

Classification:
  Confidence > 0.6 → Vegetation

  Then by height:
    0-0.5m   → Low vegetation (Class 3)
    0.5-2m   → Medium vegetation (Class 4)
    >2m      → High vegetation (Class 5)
```

**Example:**

- **Before:** Only high NDVI (>0.3) classified as vegetation
- **After:** Multi-feature approach captures sparse vegetation, stressed vegetation

#### Step 4: Building Refinement

Expands building polygons to capture all building points:

```python
Building Polygon Expansion:
  Original polygon + 0.5m buffer → Expanded polygon

Building Validation Criteria:
  ✓ Height: ≥ 1.5m (elevated)
  ✓ Planarity: ≥ 0.65 OR Verticality: ≥ 0.6 (flat roofs or walls)
  ✓ NDVI: ≤ 0.20 (not vegetation)
```

**Example:**

- **Before:** Building edges/corners unclassified due to polygon mismatch
- **After:** All building points classified, including edges

# Create custom configuration
config = GroundTruthRefinementConfig()
config.WATER_HEIGHT_MAX = 0.5  # More tolerant

# Refine classification
refined_labels, stats = refiner.refine_all(
    labels=labels,
    points=points,
    ground_truth_features=ground_truth_features,
    features={

print(f"Roads validated: {stats['road_validated']}")
print(f"Vegetation added: {stats['vegetation_added']}")
print(f"Buildings expanded: {stats['building_expanded']}")

## Performance

### Computational Cost

- **Water Refinement:** ~0.1-0.3s per tile
- **Road Refinement:** ~0.2-0.5s per tile
- **Vegetation Refinement:** ~0.5-1.0s per tile
- **Building Refinement:** ~0.5-1.5s per tile
- **Total Overhead:** ~1.5-3.5s per tile

### Memory Usage

- Minimal additional memory (mostly boolean masks)
- ~50-100MB temporary arrays for 18M point tile

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Too many points rejected

**Solution:** Adjust thresholds in configuration

```python
config.WATER_HEIGHT_MAX = 0.5  # More tolerant
config.ROAD_PLANARITY_MIN = 0.80  # Less strict
```

### Issue: Tree canopy still classified as road

**Solution:** Lower NDVI threshold for vegetation detection

```python
config.VEG_NDVI_MIN = 0.20  # Capture more vegetation
```

### Issue: Building edges still unclassified

**Solution:** Increase building polygon expansion

```python
config.BUILDING_BUFFER_EXPAND = 1.0  # Larger buffer
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always enable refinement** - Default settings work well for most cases
2. **Validate results** - Check classification statistics and visual inspection
3. **Adjust thresholds** - Fine-tune for specific environments (urban vs rural)
4. **Use all features** - Refinement works best with height, planarity, curvature, normals, NDVI
5. **Monitor performance** - Refinement adds 1.5-3.5s per tile (acceptable overhead)
