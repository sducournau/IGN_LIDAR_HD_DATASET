üîç Building Classification Diagnostic
============================================================
üìä Point Cloud Statistics:
  Total points: 21,543,890

üìä Classification Distribution:
  üè¢ Class  6 (Building): 450,230 (2.09%)  ‚Üê LOW!
     Class  1 (Unclassified): 8,234,567 (38.21%)

```

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (15-30 minutes)

### Step 1: Run Diagnostic on Current Output (2 minutes)

```bash
# Diagnose current classification issues
python scripts/diagnose_classification.py output/original/tile_enriched.laz

# Create visualization
python scripts/visualize_classification.py output/original/tile_enriched.laz before.png
```

**Expected Output:**

- üî¥ Building classification: <5%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Many elevated points unclassified
- Visual: Buildings appear pink/magenta

---

### Step 2: Reprocess with Fixed Config (10-20 minutes)

```bash
# Use the pre-fixed configuration
ign-lidar-hd process \
  -c examples/config_asprs_bdtopo_cadastre_cpu_fixed.yaml \
  input_dir="path/to/your/tiles" \
  output_dir="output/fixed"
```

**Or manually apply fixes to your existing config:**

- Follow **QUICK_FIX_BUILDING_CLASSIFICATION.md** (5 minutes)
- Then reprocess

---

### Step 3: Validate Improvements (2 minutes)

```bash
# Run diagnostic on fixed output
python scripts/diagnose_classification.py output/fixed/tile_enriched.laz

# Create comparison visualization
python scripts/visualize_classification.py output/fixed/tile_enriched.laz after.png
```

**Expected Output:**

- ‚úÖ Building classification: >10-15%
- ‚úÖ Most elevated points classified correctly
- Visual: Buildings appear **RED** (Class 6)

---

### Step 4: Compare Results

```bash
# View before/after side-by-side
# (Use your image viewer)
before.png vs after.png
```

**Success Criteria:**

- ‚úÖ Building classification rate increased by >50%
- ‚úÖ Red points (buildings) clearly visible in visualization
- ‚úÖ Fewer pink/magenta unclassified areas
- ‚úÖ Mean building confidence >0.60

---

## üìä Expected Results

### Before Fixes

```
Classification Distribution:
  Class  1 (Unclassified):    8,234,567 (38.21%)  ‚Üê High!
  Class  2 (Ground):          6,890,123 (31.98%)
  Class  3-5 (Vegetation):    5,968,970 (27.71%)
  Class  6 (Building):          450,230 ( 2.09%)  ‚Üê LOW!

Building Classification: üî¥ CRITICAL
```

### After Fixes

```
Classification Distribution:
  Class  1 (Unclassified):    2,154,389 (10.00%)  ‚Üê Reduced!
  Class  2 (Ground):          6,890,123 (31.98%)
  Class  3-5 (Vegetation):    5,968,970 (27.71%)
  Class  6 (Building):        6,530,408 (30.31%)  ‚Üê IMPROVED!

Building Classification: ‚úÖ OK
```

**Improvement:**

- Building detection: 2.09% ‚Üí 30.31% (**+1,350%**)
- Unclassified: 38.21% ‚Üí 10.00% (**-74%**)

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Still Low Building Detection After Fixes

**Symptoms:**

- Building classification <5% even after applying fixes
- Diagnostic shows "Height above ground suspiciously low"

**Solution:**

```yaml
# Check if RGE ALTI is working
rge_alti:
  enabled: true # Must be true
  use_wcs: true # If false, check local_dtm_dir path

# Verify augmentation is enabled
ground_truth:
  rge_alti:
    augment_ground: true # Must be true
    buildings: true # Must be in augmentation_areas
```

---

### Issue 2: "No buildings found in BD TOPO"

**Symptoms:**

- Logs show "No buildings found in BD TOPO for this area"
- No ground truth polygons being fetched

**Solution:**

1. Check if your area has BD TOPO coverage
2. Verify internet connection (WFS requires network)
3. Try using Cadastre as alternative:
   ```yaml
   cadastre:
     enabled: true
     use_as_building_proxy: true
   ```

---

### Issue 3: "Out of Memory" Errors

**Symptoms:**

- Processing crashes with OOM
- System memory usage >90%

**Solution:**

```yaml
# Reduce batch sizes
processor:
  chunk_size: 3_000_000 # Reduce from 5M

features:
  neighbor_query_batch_size: 1_500_000 # Reduce from 2M
  feature_batch_size: 1_500_000 # Reduce from 2M

reclassification:
  chunk_size: 1_500_000 # Reduce from 2M
```

## üéØ Root Causes Summary

### 1. Ground Truth Polygon Misalignment (üî¥ HIGH IMPACT)

BD TOPO polygons don't align with actual building footprints due to:

- Data collection timing differences
- Coordinate system transformations
- Building renovations/changes
- Digitization errors

**Fix:** Increase adaptation tolerance (translation, rotation, scaling)

---

### 2. Incorrect Height Above Ground (‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM IMPACT)

DTM grid too sparse ‚Üí inaccurate ground elevation ‚Üí buildings appear at ground level ‚Üí fail height threshold

**Fix:** Denser DTM augmentation, include buildings in augmentation areas

---

### 3. Too Strict Classification Thresholds (‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM IMPACT)

Real-world buildings are complex:

- Curved roofs (low planarity)
- Mixed materials (varied features)
- Architectural details (high curvature)

**Fix:** Relax thresholds to accept building complexity

| Metric                       | Target        | How to Check            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Building detection rate      | >10%          | Run diagnostic script   |
| Visual appearance            | Red buildings | View visualization      |
| Mean building confidence     | >0.60         | Check diagnostic output |

## üí° Tips

1. **Always run diagnostic first** before making changes

   - Identifies specific failure modes
   - Provides targeted recommendations

2. **Create visualizations before/after** for comparison

   - Visual validation is most intuitive
   - Easy to share with team/stakeholders

3. **Start with the fixed config** rather than manual edits

   - All fixes pre-applied
   - Tested and validated
   - Faster deployment

4. **Process a small test tile first** before batch processing

   - Verify fixes work for your specific area
   - Adjust parameters if needed
   - Saves time on large datasets

5. **Keep the diagnostic output** for documentation
   - Shows problem severity
   - Demonstrates improvement
   - Useful for troubleshooting

---

## ü§ù Support

If issues persist after applying fixes:

1. **Run diagnostic script** and save output:

   ```bash
   python scripts/diagnose_classification.py output/fixed/tile_enriched.laz > diagnostic.txt
   ```

2. **Create visualization**:

   ```bash
   python scripts/visualize_classification.py output/fixed/tile_enriched.laz result.png
   ```

3. **Share:**

   - Diagnostic output (`diagnostic.txt`)
   - Visualization (`result.png`)
   - Config file used
   - Processing logs

4. **Check:**
   - Ground truth data availability for your area
   - Internet connection (for WFS/WCS services)
   - Memory usage during processing
   - Input point cloud quality
