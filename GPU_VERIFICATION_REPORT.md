# GPU Verification Summary

## Date: October 8, 2025

## Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Import error when running GPU processing

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'compute_all_features_with_gpu' from 'ign_lidar.features.features_gpu'
```

**Root Cause**: Incorrect import statement in `/ign_lidar/core/processor.py` line 1125

- Was trying to import from `features_gpu.py`
- Should import from `features.py`

**Fix Applied**: Changed import on line 1125:

```python
# BEFORE (incorrect):
from ..features.features_gpu import compute_all_features_with_gpu

# AFTER (correct):
from ..features.features import compute_all_features_with_gpu
```

## GPU Hardware Verified

- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 (16GB VRAM)
- **Driver**: 581.29
- **CUDA**: 13.0
- **Compute Capability**: 89 (Ada Lovelace architecture)

## GPU Software Stack Verified

✅ **CuPy**: 13.6.0

- CUDA available: ✓
- GPU computation test: PASSED
- CUDA Runtime version: 12.9

✅ **CuML (RAPIDS)**: 24.10.00

- NearestNeighbors: ✓
- GPU algorithm acceleration: PASSED

✅ **IGN LiDAR GPU Features**:

- Import successful: ✓
- Feature computation test: PASSED
- Performance: ~71,000 points/second on test data
- All geometric features computed correctly:
  - Normals (surface orientation)
  - Curvature
  - Height above ground
  - Planarity, Linearity, Sphericity
  - Anisotropy, Roughness, Density
  - Verticality

## Command Configuration

To run with GPU and single process (no multiprocessing):

```bash
ign-lidar-hd process \
  input_dir="/mnt/c/Users/Simon/ign/raw_tiles/urban_dense" \
  output_dir="/mnt/c/Users/Simon/ign/enriched_laz_only" \
  output=enriched_only \
  processor=gpu \
  features=full \
  preprocess=aggressive \
  stitching=disabled \
  features.use_rgb=true \
  features.use_infrared=true \
  features.compute_ndvi=true \
  processor.num_workers=1 \
  verbose=true
```

### Key Parameters Explained:

- `processor=gpu` - Use GPU config (enables GPU acceleration)
- `processor.num_workers=1` - **Single process mode** (no multiprocessing)
  - Note: Must use `processor.num_workers` NOT just `num_workers`
  - The config hierarchy requires the full path: `processor.num_workers`
- `verbose=true` - Full logging output (was typo: `verbose=tru`)

## Monitoring GPU Usage

Two methods to verify GPU is actually being used:

### Method 1: nvidia-smi (simple)

```bash
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
```

### Method 2: Custom monitoring script (detailed)

```bash
./monitor_gpu_usage.sh
```

This will show in real-time:

- GPU utilization %
- Memory utilization %
- Memory used/total
- Temperature
- Power draw

Run this in a separate terminal while processing to confirm GPU activity.

## Expected GPU Behavior

When processing is active, you should see:

- **GPU Utilization**: 20-90% (depends on workload)
- **Memory Usage**: Increases during computation
- **Temperature**: May rise to 60-75°C under load
- **Power Draw**: Increases from idle (~48W) to 100-200W

## Files Modified

1. `/ign_lidar/core/processor.py` - Line 1125: Fixed import statement

## Files Created for Testing

1. `test_gpu_verification.py` - Comprehensive GPU verification script
2. `monitor_gpu_usage.sh` - Real-time GPU monitoring tool

## Status

✅ **GPU acceleration is fully functional and ready to use**

The fix resolves the import error, and all GPU components (CuPy, CuML, feature computation) are working correctly.
