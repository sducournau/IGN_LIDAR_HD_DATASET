## How to Use

### Method 1: Class Methods

```python
from ign_lidar.features.features_gpu_chunked import GPUChunkedFeatureComputer
from sklearn.neighbors import KDTree

# Initialize
computer = GPUChunkedFeatureComputer(
    chunk_size=5_000_000,
    vram_limit_gb=8.0,
    use_gpu=True
)

# Compute normals
normals = computer.compute_normals_chunked(points, k=10)

# Get neighbors
tree = KDTree(points, metric='euclidean')
_, neighbors_indices = tree.query(points, k=10)

# Compute enhanced features
eig_feat = computer.compute_eigenvalue_features(points, normals, neighbors_indices)
arch_feat = computer.compute_architectural_features(points, normals, neighbors_indices)
dens_feat = computer.compute_density_features(points, neighbors_indices)
```

### Method 2: Wrapper Functions

```python
from ign_lidar.features import features_gpu_chunked

# Same API as CPU/GPU versions
eig_feat = features_gpu_chunked.compute_eigenvalue_features(
    points, normals, neighbors_indices
)
arch_feat = features_gpu_chunked.compute_architectural_features(
    points, normals, neighbors_indices
)
dens_feat = features_gpu_chunked.compute_density_features(
    points, neighbors_indices
)
```

### Method 3: Configuration File

```yaml
# Enable in your config.yaml
processing:
  use_gpu: true
  use_gpu_chunked: true # ← Now includes all enhanced features!

features:
  mode: "lod3" # Full 37 features available in chunked mode
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify:

```bash
python tests/test_gpu_chunked_enhanced_features.py
```

Expected output:

```
✅ Eigenvalue Features Test PASSED
✅ Architectural Features Test PASSED
✅ Density Features Test PASSED
✅ Wrapper Functions Test PASSED
✅ Feature Parity Test PASSED
```

## Benefits

✅ **Large Dataset Support** - Process 10M+ points with full LOD3 features  
✅ **Memory Efficient** - Chunked processing prevents VRAM exhaustion  
✅ **Feature Complete** - Same features as CPU/GPU modes  
✅ **API Compatible** - Drop-in replacement, no code changes needed  
✅ **Production Ready** - Fully tested and validated

## Feature Parity Matrix

| Mode        | Core | Eigenvalue | Architectural | Density | Total |
| ----------- | ---- | ---------- | ------------- | ------- | ----- |
| CPU         | ✅   | ✅ (7)     | ✅ (4)        | ✅ (4)  | 15+   |
| GPU         | ✅   | ✅ (7)     | ✅ (4)        | ✅ (4)  | 15+   |
| GPU Chunked | ✅   | ✅ (7)     | ✅ (4)        | ✅ (4)  | 15+   |

**Status: 100% Feature Parity Achieved! 🎉**
