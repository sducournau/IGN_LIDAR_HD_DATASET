# Example Configuration: UnifiedFeatureComputer with Forced CPU Mode
#
# This configuration forces CPU computation mode, which is optimal for:
# - Small to medium point clouds
# - Systems without GPU
# - Development/debugging
# - Reproducible results
#
# Use this when you want deterministic CPU computation.
