# LOD3 Training Patches Configuration - 50m Scale (Fine Details)
# ========================================================================
# Purpose: Generate ML training patches focusing on fine architectural details
#
# Key Features:
# - Small patch size (50m) for local features: windows, balconies, ornaments
# - Point count (24k) suitable for detailed geometric analysis
# - Higher overlap (15%) to capture boundary features
# - More augmentations (5) for increased training diversity
# - Smaller k-neighbors (20) for fine-grained feature computation
#
# Use Case:
# - Training on small residential buildings
# - Fine architectural detail classification
# - Local texture and pattern recognition
# - Part of multi-scale training strategy (Phase 1)
#
# Output Example:
#   LHD_FXX_0649_6863_hybrid_patch_0001.npz (24,576 points)
#   LHD_FXX_0649_6863_hybrid_patch_0001.laz
