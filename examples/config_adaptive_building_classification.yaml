# IGN LiDAR HD - Adaptive Building Classification (Enhanced V5.2.2)
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: Demonstrate adaptive building classification with flexible ground truth
#
# NEW APPROACH - Ground Truth as Guidance:
# - BD TOPO polygons guide classification but don't strictly define boundaries
# - Point cloud features drive the final classification decisions
# - Fuzzy boundaries allow smooth transitions at polygon edges
# - Adaptive expansion captures building points outside polygons
# - Intelligent rejection filters non-building points inside polygons
# - Multi-feature confidence scoring (height + geometry + spectral + spatial)
#
# Use Cases:
# - Buildings with inaccurate BD TOPO footprints (wrong dimensions, misalignment)
# - Missing walls in cadastral data (internal structures, extensions)
# - Vegetation on/near buildings (green roofs, trees touching walls)
# - Small structures not in BD TOPO (sheds, garages, annexes)
