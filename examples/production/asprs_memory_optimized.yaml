# IGN LiDAR HD - ASPRS Facade Enhanced v6.7 CPU
# ============================================================================
# FACADE ENHANCED VERSION - CPU OPTIMIZED
# For systems with moderate RAM (32-40GB) requiring superior facade detection
# - CPU PROCESSING MODE
#
# üÜï v6.7 FACADE CLASSIFICATION IMPROVEMENTS:
# Major improvements to building facade detection based on real-world validation
#
# Based on v6.7 with CPU OPTIMIZATIONS:
#
# üî• CPU OPTIMIZATIONS:
# 1. DISABLED GPU: use_gpu = false
# 2. PARALLEL PROCESSING: 8 CPU workers (adjust based on cores)
# 3. LARGER CHUNKS: 5M points per chunk (vs 2M for GPU)
# 4. OPTIMIZED BATCH PROCESSING: Efficient CPU memory usage
# 5. NO GPU MONITORING: Disabled GPU usage tracking
#
# üè¢ FACADE ENHANCEMENT v6.7 (IMPROVED):
# 1. LARGER LATERAL BUFFERS: 1.5-12.0m ‚Üí 1.5-10.0m (optimized adaptive range)
# 2. MORE PERMISSIVE VERTICALITY: 0.70‚Üí0.55 (captures more textured/semi-vertical facades)
# 3. ENHANCED GAP DETECTION: 96‚Üí120 resolution, 4.0‚Üí5.5m band (better missing wall detection)
# 4. LOWER HEIGHT THRESHOLDS: 1.5‚Üí0.5m (catches very low walls/annexes/facades)
# 5. RELAXED NDVI FILTERING: max 0.20‚Üí0.25 (tolerates vegetation near buildings)
# 6. AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION: 3.5‚Üí4.0m search radius + 2.5m initial buffer
#
# EXPECTED MEMORY FOOTPRINT (CPU - OPTIMIZED):
# - Peak: ~45-55GB (increased with larger chunks)
# - Processing: ~35-45GB average
# - Requires 64GB+ RAM systems for safe operation
#
# PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS (CPU OPTIMIZED - 8 workers):
# - Feature computation: ~12-18 min per tile (improved with parallelization)
# - Classification: ~2-4 min per tile (faster with larger chunks)
# - Total: ~18-28 min per tile (significantly faster than single-threaded)
# - ~40-50% faster than single-threaded CPU, ~1.5-2x slower than GPU
#
# CPU CONFIGURATION RECOMMENDATIONS (OPTIMIZED):
# - num_workers: Set to 75-85% of available CPU cores (currently 8)
#   * 8-core CPU: num_workers = 6-8 ‚úÖ CURRENT
#   * 12-core CPU: num_workers = 10-12
#   * 16-core CPU: num_workers = 12-14
# - chunk_size: 10M points for high-RAM systems (currently 10M)
#   * If <32GB RAM: reduce to 3-4M
#   * If 32-48GB RAM: use 5-7M
#   * If >64GB RAM: use 10-15M ‚úÖ CURRENT

# USAGE NOTES - CPU OPTIMIZED VERSION v6.7
# ============================================================================
#
# VERSION: 6.7.0-cpu - FACADE ENHANCED (CPU)
# CPU-OPTIMIZED CONFIGURATION WITH v6.7 FACADE IMPROVEMENTS
#
# üÜï v6.7 FACADE CLASSIFICATION IMPROVEMENTS:
# Based on real-world validation, significant improvements to building facade detection:
# 1. Lower verticality thresholds: 0.70 ‚Üí 0.55 (code), 0.45 ‚Üí 0.35 (config)
# 2. Lower height minimums: 1.5m ‚Üí 0.5m (captures low walls and annexes)
# 3. Larger initial buffers: 2.0m ‚Üí 2.5m (better facade point capture)
# 4. Extended adaptive buffers: max 8m ‚Üí 10m (deeper facade search)
# 5. Relaxed confidence: 0.35 ‚Üí 0.25 (accepts more uncertain facades)
# 6. Improved NDVI tolerance: 0.20 ‚Üí 0.25 (handles vegetation near buildings)
#
# üî• CPU CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS:
# 1. use_gpu: false - CPU processing mode
# 2. num_workers: 1 - Single-threaded (set higher for parallel processing)
# 3. chunk_size: 5M points - Optimal CPU batch size
# 4. track_gpu_usage: false - No GPU monitoring
#
# üíª CPU WORKER TUNING GUIDE:
# Set num_workers based on available CPU cores:
# - 4-core CPU: num_workers = 3-4
# - 6-core CPU: num_workers = 5-6
# - 8-core CPU: num_workers = 6-8 (recommended)
# - 12-core CPU: num_workers = 10-12
# - 16+ core CPU: num_workers = 12-16
#
# Rule of thumb: Use 75-85% of total cores to leave headroom for OS/other tasks
#
# üéØ MEMORY TUNING (OPTIMIZED):
# Configuration optimized for high-RAM systems:
# - <32GB RAM: chunk_size = 3_000_000, num_workers = 4
# - 32-48GB RAM: chunk_size = 5_000_000, num_workers = 6
# - 48-64GB RAM: chunk_size = 8_000_000, num_workers = 8
# - >64GB RAM: chunk_size = 10_000_000, num_workers = 8 ‚úÖ CURRENT
#
# ‚è±Ô∏è EXPECTED PERFORMANCE (CPU OPTIMIZED MODE):
# System: 8-core CPU, 64GB+ RAM, 18M point tile
# - Feature computation: ~12-18 min
# - DTM augmentation: ~1-2 min
# - Ground truth: ~3-4 min (parallel processing, larger chunks)
# - Classification: ~2-3 min (faster with 10M chunks)
# - Total: ~18-28 min per tile (40% faster than default CPU config)
#
# Comparison to GPU (RTX 4080):
# - CPU is ~2-3x slower overall
# - No VRAM limitations
# - Better for systems without powerful GPU
# - Can process larger tiles with sufficient RAM
#
# üè¢ FACADE DETECTION v6.7 (improved from previous versions):
# 1. Lateral buffers: 1.5-10.0m - capture facades/courtyards (optimized from 12m)
# 2. Verticality: 0.35-0.55 - catch textured/semi-vertical walls (lowered from 0.70)
# 3. Gap detection: 120 resolution, 5.5m band - find missing walls (up from 96/4.0m)
# 4. Height thresholds: 0.5m min - include very low walls/annexes (down from 1.5m)
# 5. NDVI filtering: max 0.25 - tolerant to nearby vegetation (up from 0.20)
# 6. Search radius: 4.0m - find facades outside polygons (up from 3.5m)
# 7. Initial buffer: 2.5m - wider initial capture zone (up from 2.0m)
#
# USAGE (OPTIMIZED FOR HIGH-RAM SYSTEMS):
#   ign-lidar-hd process \
#     -c examples/production/asprs_memory_optimized.yaml \
#     input_dir="/data/lidar/tiles" \
#     output_dir="/data/output_v6.7_cpu_optimized"
#
# NOTE: This configuration requires 64GB+ RAM for optimal performance
#
# PARALLEL PROCESSING NOTE:
# The library will automatically use scikit-learn's joblib for parallel
# CPU processing. KD-tree construction and feature computation will be
# parallelized across the specified num_workers.
#
# WHEN TO USE CPU VERSION:
# - No GPU available or GPU has <8GB VRAM
# - System has good CPU (8+ cores recommended)
# - Sufficient RAM (32GB+)
# - Processing time is not critical
# - Batch processing overnight
#
# WHEN TO USE GPU VERSION:
# - GPU with 12GB+ VRAM available (RTX 3080+, RTX 4080+)
# - Need faster processing (2-3x speedup)
# - Real-time or interactive processing
# - Large production runs
#
# OPTIMIZATION TIPS (HIGH-RAM SYSTEM):
# 1. Increase num_workers to 10-12 if you have 12+ cores
# 2. Increase chunk_size to 15M if you have >128GB RAM
# 3. Monitor with htop/top during processing (aim for 60-70% RAM usage)
# 4. Use cache_enabled: true to avoid reprocessing
# 5. Can process 2-3 tiles in parallel with 128GB+ RAM
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# If processing too slow:
# 1. Increase num_workers (up to CPU core count)
# 2. Consider GPU version if available
#
# If out of memory (unlikely with this config on 64GB+ systems):
# 1. Reduce chunk_size to 7M or 5M
# 2. Reduce num_workers to 4-6
# 3. Disable DTM augmentation (augment_ground: false)
# 4. Check for memory leaks or other processes consuming RAM
#
# If facades still missing (after v6.7 improvements, should be rare):
# 1. Increase adaptive_buffer_max to 12m (from 10m)
# 2. Lower min_verticality to 0.30 (from 0.35)
# 3. Increase gap_detection_band_width to 6.5m (from 5.5m)
# 4. Lower min_facade_height to 0.3m (from 0.5m)
# 5. Check point density (<5 pts/m¬≤ problematic)
#
# For comparison with v6.6 results:
# - v6.7 should show significantly more green (building) points
# - Facades outlined in white should now be classified correctly
# - Less blue misclassification in building areas
# - Better contour precision around building edges
