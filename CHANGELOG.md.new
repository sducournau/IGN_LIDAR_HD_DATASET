## [5.2.1] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- **Automatic DTM fallback:** LiDAR HD MNT → RGE ALTI when primary WMS service fails
- **Enhanced error messages:** More informative DTM fetch failure messages with actionable tips
- **DTM source tracking:** Metadata now includes which DTM source was used (LiDAR HD or RGE ALTI)
- **Comprehensive documentation:** New `DTM_FALLBACK_GUIDE.md` with troubleshooting and best practices
- **Implementation guide:** New `DTM_FALLBACK_IMPLEMENTATION.md` with technical details

### Changed
- **`rge_alti_fetcher.py`:** `_fetch_from_wms()` now tries multiple WMS layers with automatic fallback
- **`processor.py`:** Improved error messages when DTM fetch fails from all sources

### Fixed
- **502 Bad Gateway errors:** System now falls back to RGE ALTI instead of skipping ground augmentation
- **Service availability:** Processing continues successfully even when primary DTM source is unavailable

### Performance
- No performance impact with caching (cache hit = instant)
- +5-10 seconds per tile only on first run if fallback occurs
- Cached runs identical regardless of DTM source used

### Migration Notes
- ✅ **Fully backwards compatible** - no configuration changes required
- Existing cache files remain valid
- Output format unchanged
- API unchanged (internal improvement only)
