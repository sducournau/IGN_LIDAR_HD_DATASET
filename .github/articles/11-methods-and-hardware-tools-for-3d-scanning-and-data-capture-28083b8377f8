The 3D Master Toolbox Chapter 1: Which Hardware? Which Methods? Which Data Sources? by Florent Poux
The 3D Master Toolbox Chapter 1: Which Hardware? Which Methods? Which Data Sources? © F. Poux
I’ve been spending a lot of time lately thinking about the tools we use in 3D data processing and how they shape both our work and our thinking. I was reminded of a quote I love:

“A good tool improves the way you work. A great tool improves the way you think.” — Jeff Duntemann

I think this is particularly true for 3D and its vast, often confusing, landscape of software, hardware, and AI solutions. It’s like having access to all of the tools for an amazing project but not knowing where to start.

Many of us, myself included, struggle with that at times. It’s hard to know which tools to select, which workflows to follow, and which 3D tech is actually worth the investment. It can feel overwhelming!

So, if you were about to enter the field of 3D, what should you put in your “3D backpack”?

I’ve been working in the 3D R&D space for over 15 years now and have experimented a lot with tools, methods, and approaches. So, let me share with you what I’ve learned: my “3D Master Toolbox,” a framework that I use daily.

It consists of 47 carefully selected tools, methods, and AI solutions that can make a difference for all of your projects.

Now, a list of 47 things can be overwhelming. This is why I have broken it down into 9 manageable categories, which I call “buckets.”

These buckets form a proven strategy I’ve used with my teams: the 3D Master Toolbox. And it actually works!

Altogether, they provide a practical way to create anything, from reconstructing an entire city to designing an intricate product. But to make the learning more manageable, I have broken down the 3D Master Toolbox into three chapters, as illustrated below.

Let me guide you through Chapter 1, which includes the first two buckets of that process: getting data and reconstructing it.

🦊 
Florent Poux, Ph.D.
: It is important to understand that these 9 buckets—from data curation and reconstruction to coding, AI, and communication—cover the entire 3D data science spectrum. By structuring all of your workflows this way, you are sure that you have the required toolkits, workflows, skills, and strategies that you need to approach a project in a clear and structured way. It is not just about selecting the right tools but about understanding the logic that ties them all together. Chapters 2 and 3 will be linked at the end of the article.

The 3D Master Toolbox: Chapter 1
Let me show you my curated list of best practices so that you can navigate the field of 3D with confidence.

Which data sources do I use? Should I use photogrammetry or LiDAR? Which hardware do I invest in? How do I put it all together?

Let me start with the mission statement.

🦊 
Florent Poux, Ph.D.
: If you are new to my (3D) writing world, welcome! We are going on an exciting adventure that will allow you to master the complete list of 3D data + AI tools. Before diving, I like to establish a clear overview.

Once the scene is laid out, we embark on the journey. Everything is given. You will see tips (🦚Notes, 🧪 R&D, and 🌱Growing) to help you get the most out of this article. Thanks to the 3D Geodata Academy for supporting the endeavor.

The Mission 🎯
You are a curious engineer tasked with an amazing project: You must create a digital twin of your favorite city from a few old photographs. On top of that, a friend who wants to build a startup asked if you think it is possible to generate a 3D model of an entire neighborhood.

You know that you will need to explore a variety of tools and methods. How do you even start?

The essentials of any 3D Data Science Project by Florent Poux

Armed with this article, you explore the sources for data acquisition and all the different approaches to generating new 3D models. It is the first step to building your own “3D Master Toolbox.” It is here to guide you on sourcing data and reconstructing the world.

It is now clear: You uncover how to get your hands on various 3D datasets, all while learning the essentials of photogrammetry, LiDAR, and generative AI-based 3D models. Then, you will be ready to develop a strategy to select the best hardware for the job, whether you want to use your phone or your next-generation laser scanners.

Let us dive right in!

Bucket 1. 3D Dataset Curation (Tools 1 to 4)
The first step in the 3D data journey is how you source the relevant data, and this is critical because it dictates the outcome of all downstream processes.

Press enter or click to view image in full size
The 3D Master ToolBox: Chapter 1. 3D Dataset Curation by Florent Poux

The goal is to obtain high-quality, relevant datasets to drive meaningful results. This process entails identifying data sources, evaluating their suitability, managing data formats, and guaranteeing data integrity, all while closely monitoring data licenses and privacy policies.

To start small, let me share four data sources where you can get your hands on 3D data (or relevant data). Let me share some tools and solutions for each 3D Data Curation Method.

🦚 Note: I have a professional deformation. I am very touchy on ethics. Hence, any recommendation for a tool and method is certified independent of any personal interests. I am affiliated with none, and I do not know the founders of these applications. Also, I made sure to limit myself to only the services and tools I use regularly, with a keen eye for open-source and fighting against too much information.

1. 3D City Models (3DCityLoader)
Getting our hands on 3D city models is not the easiest road. But we are getting there, thanks to the strategic plans of our nations and 3DCityLoader (among others).

This is an excellent service that I recently started using as part of my scientific activities. 3Dcityloader converts 3D city data from public sources into practical file formats like CityGML, STL, or OBJ. As mentioned by 3DcityLoader:

“The service’s data comes directly from the respective cities, which usually provide it as CityGML. The detail level is, therefore, much higher than with other sources, like OpenStreetMap.”

It allows me to build new experiments fast, where 3D geospatial elements can be easily integrated into various software (see Bucket 3: Chapter 2).

2. 3D LiDAR Data (Point Clouds)
This is my favorite data modality: a bunch of 3D points that describe a scene. I love 3D point clouds, mainly thanks to their ability to describe with an unlimited depth (you can describe an entire country or a single object with points). And you can get a lot of 3D point clouds from the web.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

For example, my core objective when using OpenTopography (or Opendata repositories) is to find and get access to large-scale LiDAR datasets for geospatial analysis. I use this service when I want to leverage point clouds for scientific research, from terrain analysis to mapping. It offers a vast collection of LiDAR data that I often need to understand the dynamics of the earth's surface. It helps to streamline my research by providing all of the data I need in one place.

You can also source national open data initiatives; here are some of my favorites:

The LidarHD in France (2025), with 10 pts/m2 (points per square meter) and a vertical accuracy of 10 cm (which is very interesting).
The City of Vancouver LiDAR data (Canada, 2022). You have some nice class information as well
The AHN LiDAR Campaigns (AHN1 to 5 currently), that you can view on the official AHN LiDAR Viewer (Netherlands, 2025).
But aside from Aerial LiDAR, you can also explore other sources such as Openheritage3d to get your hands on terrestrial laser scanner data of heritage sites (among other things) or a little gem (close to my heart): Florence As It Was.

Usually, you will gather point clouds in the. LAZ (Aerial LiDAR, comrpessed), .e57 (for terrestrial laser scanner, may include panoramas) or the. PLY file format (more generic open format, common in the research community).

Now, what about getting our hands on 3D assets?

3. 3D Assets (Sketchfab / TurboSquid)
When I visit Sketchfab or TurboSquid, my main goal is to find specific, high-quality 3D models or assets for my projects, where I can find a massive number of options.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

I usually go there when I need a unique asset with a particular format and texture. The best thing about these platforms is that they provide different categories and licensing options, and they also allow for direct integration into many 3D software. I can find anything, from a simple component to an entire3D scene.

4. External Data Sources
You often need external information from other non-3D modalities for spatial applications. This is where I tap into external sources such as Mappillary, OpenStreetMap, or the Google Dataset Search engine. From there, you can get access to a range of data that is not easily available on other dedicated platforms.

External data sources such as mappillary (360° imagery), google datasets (to develop machine learning systems) or OpenStreet maps (vector data) by Florent Poux

I use Mappillary for 360 imagery, OpenStreetMap for vector data, and Google Dataset Search for diverse research datasets. This is very interesting, as I can use this to create “data-rich” urban scenarios, sourcing all the relevant information for my research (e.g., roads as vectors, raster imagers, etc.).

These external sources thus serve as complementary sources to my core databases of 3D datasets and usually allow me to extend the scope of possibilities through multi-modal processes.

🎁 Bonus: This would not be complete without citing my various tutorials on Medium, which share 3D datasets with open licenses, such as the one below (you can play around with the 3D point cloud on the web: WebGL Real-Time 3D).

🌱Growing: Current research is particularly interested in building automated systems for organizing data. Of course, the main aim is to lessen the manual work involved while improving the data quality. But underlying this also involves using AI tools to tidy up data, verify its quality, adjust its structure, etc.

I want to share some words on the current trends and extraordinary innovations around these aspects. The first element is that I saw some admirable R&D efforts to push the development storage solutions for 3D assets. This is interesting because it provides straightforward data descriptions to help locate the assets more efficiently.

On top, and with the rise of generative AI, there is a strong emphasis on creating datasets to train new kinds of AI architecture, which needs well-designed and specific datasets.

These constitute your four ideal sources for 3D data and are illustrated below.

Of course, these sources can also be generated on your own when what you need is not accessible through online repositories. Therefore, let us talk about the 3D reconstruction methods or how to generate these 3D datasets.

Bucket 2. 3D Reconstruction Methods (Tools 5 to 11)
3D reconstruction involves creating 3D models of physical objects from sensors (images, laser scanners, lidar) and other techniques (such as 3D generative AI).

In modern 3D data capture, the central two concepts are image-based methods (photogrammetry), which leverage several images to derive a 3D model, and laser-based methods (LiDAR), which measure distance and angles to reconstruct 3D shapes. You can see two examples of 3D point clouds resulting from these techniques from projects (companies or universities) I supervise:

🦚 Note: You do not see it, but I am sweating, fighting against my desire to share a 200-page long course, supported by a 40-hour class on LiDAR and photogrammetry. But I will spare you. at least in here. Just now, these are two “techniques” that leverage either a passive sensor (photogrammetry) or an active one (lasergrammetry) to generate 3D datasets in the form of point clouds.

The hardware used includes cameras, laser scanners, or range cameras. These systems capture the physical measurements, while software algorithms work in the background to reconstruct the subject’s geometry and appearance. With a very simplified view, you can then consider a 3D Data Capture job as shown in the following workflow.

With modern surveying, the main differences are essentially attached to the level of accuracy, visual fidelity, and production setup.

Another approach is 3D generative modeling. With new AI advances, you can use tools like Microsoft Trellis to generate data with image or text prompts. This is usually pure inference work and is not directly measured like LiDAR. Below is an example I made using Python and this 3D Master Toolbox, which I will explain in future chapters.

These are best suited for low-visibility situations such as nighttime, foggy weather, or areas with limited light. They can also penetrate through some materials, making them ideal for certain subsurface investigations. These sensors are mostly used for long-distance scanning or large-area mapping.

Recommended Material List:

RADAR system
Processing software
Price Range:

RADAR system: $20,000 — $500,000+ ( depending on resolution and range)
Software: $1,000 — $50,000+
🦚 Note: Keep in mind that these prices can vary depending on several factors: the brand, the features, the resolution, the accuracy, your location, ... The software costs can also change depending if you are subscribing or purchasing a perpetual license.

If you look at the industry, you will find that methods to reduce the cost of 3D scanners are constantly being investigated to enable easier access to the technology (which is a good thing in my opinion).

🌱 Growing: The current production-ready R&D is focused on two main aspects: (1) improving reconstruction accuracy and efficiency (e.g., by combining different sensor types through data fusion) and also answering a growing interest in real-time reconstruction using embedded devices and mobile systems. Also, and you may be familiar with this, we have a new wave of advancements in AI algorithms touching on neural radiation fields (NeRFs). Without going too much into details, these are making it possible to reconstruct complex scenes with much higher detail or visual fidelity (see 3D Gaussian Splatting).

Okay, you now have your data and can reconstruct your 3D models, and you have a way to select the best tool for the job, as seen below.
