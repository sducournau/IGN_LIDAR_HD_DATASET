You may have heard of image-based 3D reconstruction from previous articles I wrote. This is a depth-first example (to save for later use):

The Ultimate Guide to 3D Reconstruction with Photogrammetry
A full hands-on 3D Reconstruction tutorial using 3D Photogrammetry, Reality Capture, Meshroom, and Blender.

Today, I want to focus on a “cut-to-the-chase” read that ensures you can take a bunch of pictures and create a 3D point cloud or 3D mesh within your Python script to develop a cool experience.

If that sounds good to you, let me quickly answer the question below:

Whenever you are ready, let us move on to the fun bits.

📦 Florent’s Resources: Please find the resources for this tutorial here—first, the Meshroom Software with its documentation. And then, an Anaconda Distribution with Python 3.9+ to use some libraries.

Let me break down the tutorial into 7 steps:

Time to move onto Stage 1: a quick (and dirty) introduction to photogrammetry.

1. Photogrammetry: introduction
So, photogrammetry is a powerful technique that allows the creation of 3D models from a series of 2D images.

Today, I will guide you on generating 3D point clouds using Python and Meshroom. The process involves capturing images, processing them in Meshroom to create a 3D model, and then using Python to manipulate and visualize the resulting point cloud, as illustrated below.

Now that you grasp what we are going to do from a high-level view, let us move on to stage 2.

2. Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:

This holds:

A camera (a smartphone camera can suffice)
A computer with Meshroom installed
Python installed on your computer
Libraries: open3d, numpy, matplotlib
You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

pip install open3d numpy matplotlib
🦚 Florent’s Note: If this is obscure to you, you can always refer to this tutorial for a minimalistic Python Setup for 3D Data Processing:

Great, everything is smooth! We now have the following pieces:

Let us capture some images.

3. Capturing Images
The quality of your 3D model heavily depends on the quality and quantity of the images you capture. Follow these guidelines for the best results:

Press enter or click to view image in full size

Florent Poux, Ph.D.
If I have to describe a bit what that means:

Capture images with good lighting and minimal shadows.
Ensure the object is in focus in all pictures.
Take photos from multiple angles to cover all sides of the object.
Overlap between consecutive images should be around 60–80%.
With these four simple directions, you should be good to go and ready to move on to stage 4.

4. Processing Images with Meshroom
Great, you now have a bunch of images that you uploaded to a local drive folder on your computer. It is time to use Meshroom, as illustrated below:

Florent Poux, Ph.D.
What you should do in detail is the following:

Open Meshroom: Launch Meshroom on your computer.
Create a New Project: Start a new project and import your images by dragging and dropping them into the Meshroom workspace.
Run the Pipeline: Click the “Start” button to run the default photogrammetry pipeline. Meshroom will process the images and generate a 3D model.
Inspect the Model: Once processing is complete, inspect the 3D model to ensure it meets your expectations.
After these steps, we can move on to stage 5: exporting our 3D dataset.

5. Exporting the Point Cloud
After generating the 3D model (yes, it is a model at this stage) in Meshroom, let us export the point cloud. If you look at my illustration below, this is what we do:

In short, that means:

Select the Output: In the Meshroom interface, navigate to the “Texturing” node.
Export: Right-click on the “Texturing” node and select “Export”. Choose the format you prefer, such as .ply or .obj.
Great, now we can move on to the next stage: six.

🦚 Florent’s Note: At this stage, if you feel like something is not properly working, then I recommend checking out the tutorial hinted before, as this holds the various deep details that I am overlooking here for the sake of quick replication.

6. Visualizing the Point Cloud with Python
Now that you have the point cloud file, you can use Python to visualize it. Below is a sample script using open3d:

import open3d as o3d
And to visualize your point cloud:

pcd = o3d.io.read_point_cloud("path_to_your_point_cloud.ply")
o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([pcd])
This brings this result for me (35 pictures):

Not bad, hun?

7. Conclusion
Generating 3D point clouds using Python and Meshroom is a straightforward process that leverages the power of photogrammetry. By following the steps outlined in this document, you can create detailed 3D models from simple 2D images and visualize them using Python.

This technique opens up numerous possibilities for applications in various fields, from virtual reality to 3D printing.

Now, I am excited to see what you do with this! It is time to put that as one other skill to your 3D Tech quiver 🏹.

Meshroom has a nice gui but Colmap is much more powerful, faster, hands-off and also free
