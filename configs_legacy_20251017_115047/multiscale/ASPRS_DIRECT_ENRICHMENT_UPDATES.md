# ASPRS Preprocessing Configuration - Full Direct Enrichment Mode

**Updated:** October 16, 2025  
**Configuration:** `config_asprs_preprocessing.yaml`

## üéØ What Changed

This update enables **FULL RECLASSIFICATION DIRECTLY DURING TILE ENRICHMENT** instead of as a post-processing step. All ground truth integration, geometric rules, and refinements are now applied in a single, optimized pass.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Configuration Changes

### 1. **Processor Configuration** (`processor` section)

#### Before:

```yaml
skip_existing: true # Skip already processed files
```

#### After:

```yaml
skip_existing: false # ‚ùå Force full reprocessing with complete reclassification
apply_reclassification_inline: true # ‚úÖ Apply during enrichment, not after
ground_truth_integration_mode: "direct" # Apply ground truth immediately
```

**Impact:** Forces complete reprocessing of all tiles with full reclassification applied directly during enrichment.

---

### 2. **Reclassification Settings** (`processor.reclassification` section)

#### Before:

```yaml
reclassification:
  enabled: true
  skip_existing: true # Skip already classified files
  gpu_chunk_size: 500000
```

#### After:

```yaml
reclassification:
  enabled: true # ‚úÖ FULL reclassification during enrichment
  skip_existing: false # ‚ùå Force full processing of all tiles
  gpu_chunk_size: 1000000 # Doubled for better GPU utilization
  chunk_size: 150000 # Increased for direct mode

  # NEW: Direct enrichment optimization
  apply_during_feature_computation: true # Apply immediately after features
  multi_pass_refinement: true # Multiple passes for higher accuracy
  max_refinement_passes: 3 # Up to 3 iterations
  convergence_threshold: 0.01 # Stop when < 1% points change
```

**Impact:**

- All tiles are fully processed (no skipping)
- Larger GPU chunks for better performance
- Multi-pass refinement for maximum accuracy
- Rules applied immediately after feature computation

---

### 3. **Ground Truth Post-Processing** (`ground_truth.post_processing` section)

#### Before:

```yaml
post_processing:
  enabled: true
  ground_truth_building_priority: medium # Standard priority
```

#### After:

```yaml
post_processing:
  enabled: true # ‚úÖ FULL post-processing during enrichment
  ground_truth_building_priority: high # ‚úÖ HIGH priority for direct mode
  aggressive_mode: true # ‚úÖ NEW: Aggressive reclassification
  max_unclassified_ratio: 0.05 # Target: < 5% unclassified
```

**Impact:**

- Ground truth gets highest priority during enrichment
- Aggressive reclassification of ambiguous points
- Target of <5% unclassified points after processing

---

## üöÄ Processing Pipeline Changes

### **Old Pipeline (2-Stage):**

```
1. Tile Enrichment (features only)
   ‚Üì
2. Reclassification Pass (separate step)
```

### **New Pipeline (1-Stage Direct):**

```
1. Tile Enrichment with FULL Reclassification
   ‚îú‚îÄ Load tile
   ‚îú‚îÄ Compute features
   ‚îú‚îÄ Apply ground truth (BD TOPO¬Æ)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Apply geometric rules
   ‚îú‚îÄ Multi-pass refinement (up to 3 iterations)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Post-process unclassified
   ‚îî‚îÄ Save enriched LAZ
```

---

## üìä Expected Benefits

### **Performance:**

- ‚úÖ **Single-pass processing** - No need for separate reclassification step
- ‚úÖ **Better GPU utilization** - Larger chunks (1M points vs 500K)
- ‚úÖ **Optimized memory usage** - Features and classification in one pass

### **Accuracy:**

- ‚úÖ **Multi-pass refinement** - Up to 3 iterations for convergence
- ‚úÖ **Aggressive mode** - Reclassifies ambiguous points
- ‚úÖ **Higher completion rate** - Target <5% unclassified points

### **Workflow:**

- ‚úÖ **Simplified pipeline** - One command does everything
- ‚úÖ **No post-processing needed** - Tiles are fully classified on output
- ‚úÖ **Immediate results** - Ready for training/analysis

## üéÆ Usage

### Run Full Direct Enrichment:

```bash
ign-lidar-hd process --config-file configs/multiscale/config_asprs_preprocessing.yaml
```

### What Happens:

1. **All tiles processed** (skip_existing=false)
2. **Full reclassification applied** during enrichment
3. **Ground truth integrated** directly (BD TOPO¬Æ)
4. **Geometric rules applied** immediately after features
5. **Multi-pass refinement** (up to 3 iterations)
6. **Unclassified points minimized** (<5% target)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Settings

### **Multi-Pass Refinement:**

```yaml
multi_pass_refinement: true
max_refinement_passes: 3
convergence_threshold: 0.01 # Stop when <1% points change
```

### **Aggressive Mode:**

```yaml
aggressive_mode: true # Reclassify ambiguous points
max_unclassified_ratio: 0.05 # Target <5% unclassified
```

### **GPU Optimization:**

```yaml
gpu_chunk_size: 1000000 # 1M points per GPU chunk
chunk_size: 150000 # 150K points per CPU chunk
```

## üîç Monitoring Progress

The configuration includes detailed progress tracking:

```yaml
show_progress: true # Real-time progress bars
logging:
  level: INFO
  progress_bar: true
```

Watch for these indicators during processing:

- ‚úÖ "Applying reclassification inline..."
- ‚úÖ "Multi-pass refinement: iteration 1/3"
- ‚úÖ "Convergence achieved at X% change"
- ‚úÖ "Unclassified ratio: X% (target: 5%)"

---

## üéØ Quality Targets

With full direct enrichment, you should achieve:

- **Building Classification:** >95% accuracy (ground truth + geometric rules)
- **Road/Railway Classification:** >90% coverage (adaptive buffering + height filtering)
- **Vegetation Classification:** >85% accuracy (NDVI + height-based)
- **Unclassified Points:** <5% (aggressive post-processing)

---

## üìö Related Configurations

- **Ground Truth:** `data_sources.bd_topo.enabled = true`
- **Transport Enhancement:** `transport_enhancement.adaptive_buffering.enabled = true`
- **Quality Metrics:** `transport_enhancement.quality_metrics.enabled = true`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Processing Time:** First run will take longer (no skip_existing), but subsequent runs benefit from cached ground truth data.

2. **Memory Usage:** Larger GPU chunks require more VRAM. Reduce `gpu_chunk_size` if you encounter OOM errors.

3. **Convergence:** If tiles don't converge after 3 passes, check `convergence_threshold` (lower = stricter).

4. **Unclassified Points:** If >5% remain unclassified, consider:
   - Lowering `min_building_planarity` threshold
   - Increasing `building_buffer_distance`
   - Enabling more aggressive NDVI thresholds
