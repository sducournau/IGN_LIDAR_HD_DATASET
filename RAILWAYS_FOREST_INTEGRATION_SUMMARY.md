# Final Summary: Railways and BD Forêt® Integration

## Overview

This enhancement adds **railway classification** and **precise forest type classification** to the IGN LiDAR HD advanced classification system.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Railway Classification (ASPRS Code 10)

**Files Modified:**

1. **`ign_lidar/io/wfs_ground_truth.py`**

   - Added `fetch_railways_with_polygons()` method
   - Fetches railway centerlines from IGN BD TOPO® V3 layer `BDTOPO_V3:troncon_de_voie_ferree`
   - Implements intelligent buffering based on track width and count
   - Default width: 3.5m per track, multiplied by `nombre_voies` for multi-track
   - Updated `fetch_all_features()` to include `include_railways` parameter

2. **`ign_lidar/core/modules/advanced_classification.py`**
   - Added `ASPRS_RAIL = 10` classification code
   - Added `('railways', self.ASPRS_RAIL)` to priority order in `_classify_by_ground_truth()`
   - Created `_classify_railways_with_buffer()` method (similar to road classification)
   - Logs railway statistics: width range, track counts, points per railway

**Key Features:**

- Uses real railway geometry from official IGN data
- Intelligent buffering: width × nombre_voies / 2
- Handles single, double, triple+ track sections
- Tracks electrification status (`electrifie` attribute)

### 2. BD Forêt® V2 Integration

**Files Created:**

1. **`ign_lidar/io/bd_foret.py`** (510 lines)

   - Complete WFS fetcher for BD Forêt® V2 data
   - **Main Class**: `BDForetFetcher`
   - **Key Methods**:

     - `fetch_forest_polygons()`: Retrieve forest formations from WFS
     - `label_points_with_forest_type()`: Assign forest types to vegetation points
     - `_classify_forest_type()`: Extract forest type from TFV code
     - `_estimate_height()`: Estimate tree height by forest type

   - **Forest Types Supported**:

     - Coniferous (closed/open)
     - Deciduous (closed/open)
     - Mixed (closed/open)
     - Young vs. mature forests

   - **Attributes Extracted**:
     - Primary/secondary/tertiary tree species
     - Species coverage rates (taux_1, taux_2, taux_3)
     - Density (closed/open/medium)
     - Structure (mature/young)
     - Estimated height by forest type (5-25m range)

**Files Modified:**

2. **`ign_lidar/core/modules/advanced_classification.py`**

   - Updated `classify_with_all_features()` function signature:

     - Added `bd_foret_fetcher` parameter
     - Added `include_railways` flag (default: True)
     - Added `include_forest` flag (default: True)
     - Returns tuple: `(labels, forest_attributes)`

   - BD Forêt® integration workflow:
     1. Fetch forest polygons via WFS
     2. Label vegetation points (ASPRS 3, 4, 5) with forest types
     3. Return detailed forest attributes dictionary
     4. Log forest type statistics

**Returned Forest Attributes:**

```python
{
    'forest_type': ['coniferous', 'deciduous', 'mixed', ...],  # [N]
    'primary_species': ['Chêne', 'Sapin', ...],                # [N]
    'species_rate': [60, 75, ...],                             # [N]
    'density': ['closed', 'open', ...],                        # [N]
    'structure': ['mature', 'young', ...],                     # [N]
    'estimated_height': [15.0, 20.0, ...]                      # [N]
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Test Railways

1. Find tiles with railways using BD TOPO®
2. Verify ASPRS code 10 is correctly applied
3. Check buffer calculations for multi-track sections
4. Validate against manual classification

### Test BD Forêt®

1. Process heavily forested tiles
2. Verify forest type distribution matches BD Forêt® data
3. Check species extraction accuracy
4. Validate height estimates against actual point cloud heights
5. Ensure non-vegetation classes are not affected

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Railway Buffering**: Assumes constant width along track, may not capture elevated platforms or complex station areas
2. **Forest Types**: BD Forêt® coverage may be incomplete in some regions
3. **Species Accuracy**: Depends on BD Forêt® data quality and update frequency
4. **Height Estimates**: Forest type-based heights are estimates, not precise measurements

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Short Term

1. Add railway platforms and station detection
2. Implement forest canopy height model validation
3. Add confidence scores for forest type assignments

### Long Term

1. Integrate more BD TOPO® layers (bridges, power lines, sports facilities)
2. Add temporal forest change detection
3. Implement species-specific classification models
4. Add railway catenary wire detection for electrified lines
