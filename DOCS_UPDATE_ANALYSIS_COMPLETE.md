# 📚 Documentation Update Analysis Complete

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Analyst:** GitHub Copilot  
**Project:** IGN LiDAR HD Documentation Update v2.0.1

---

## 🎯 Summary

I've completed a comprehensive analysis of your codebase and Docusaurus documentation, and prepared a complete plan to update the documentation from **v1.7.6 to v2.0.1**.

### Critical Finding

Your codebase is at **v2.0.1** with major architectural changes, but your documentation website still shows **v1.7.6**. This creates a significant gap that will confuse users trying to use the new features.

## 🔧 Tools & Commands

### Check Current State
```bash
# Count files with old version
grep -r "1\.7\.[0-9]" website/docs/ --include="*.md" | wc -l

# Find old imports
grep -r "from ign_lidar import" website/docs/ --include="*.md"

# Check missing Hydra docs
grep -r "hydra" website/docs/ --include="*.md" -i
```

### Development Workflow
```bash

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Work Smart
1. **Start with quick wins** - Update version badge first for immediate visibility
2. **Work in parallel** - Multiple people can update different sections
3. **Test as you go** - Run code examples while writing
4. **Deploy incrementally** - Don't wait for everything to be perfect
5. **Get feedback early** - Share Week 1 results with users

### Avoid Pitfalls
1. ❌ Don't update all 122 files - Focus on the 49 that need changes
2. ❌ Don't wait to deploy - Ship critical updates first
3. ❌ Don't skip testing - Broken examples frustrate users
4. ❌ Don't ignore links - Broken links hurt credibility
5. ❌ Don't forget mobile - Test responsive design

### Stay Motivated
- Week 1 results are highly visible (version update)
- Week 2 completes critical CLI docs
- Week 3 showcases exciting new features
- Week 4 serves developer audience
