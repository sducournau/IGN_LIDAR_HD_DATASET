# GPU Dependencies Configuration Summary

## ✅ Changes Made

All configuration files have been updated to properly document CuPy and RAPIDS cuML as optional GPU dependencies.

### Files Updated:

#### 1. `requirements.txt`
- ✅ Added comprehensive comments about GPU dependencies
- ✅ Documented both CuPy (basic) and cuML (full) GPU acceleration
- ✅ Added instructions for choosing correct CUDA version
- ✅ Referenced requirements_gpu.txt for detailed GPU installation

#### 2. `requirements_gpu.txt`
- ✅ Already well-documented (no changes needed)
- ✅ Contains detailed installation instructions
- ✅ Includes verification commands
- ✅ Documents performance expectations

#### 3. `pyproject.toml`
- ✅ Already properly configured with optional dependencies
- ✅ Has `[gpu]` and `[gpu-full]` extras defined
- ✅ Includes clear installation notes

#### 4. `conda-recipe/environment.yml`
- ✅ Added commented GPU dependency sections
- ✅ Documented CuPy installation options
- ✅ Documented RAPIDS cuML installation requirements
- ✅ Added h5py to base dependencies

#### 5. `conda-recipe/meta.yaml`
- ✅ Added `run_constrained` section for optional GPU dependencies
- ✅ Documents cupy and cuml as optional with installation notes
- ✅ Added h5py to runtime dependencies

#### 6. `conda-recipe/README.md`
- ✅ Added Option 3 with GPU acceleration instructions
- ✅ Referenced GPU_SETUP.md for detailed guidance
- ✅ Included manual and automated installation methods

#### 7. `GPU_SETUP.md` (NEW)
- ✅ Created comprehensive GPU setup documentation
- ✅ Explains the warnings users see
- ✅ Performance comparison table
- ✅ Step-by-step installation for both basic and full GPU
- ✅ Troubleshooting section
- ✅ Configuration files summary

## 🎯 User Experience

### Before:
```
⚠ CuPy non disponible - fallback CPU
⚠ RAPIDS cuML non disponible - fallback sklearn
```
Users see warnings but documentation wasn't clear about optional dependencies.

### After:
Users now have clear documentation in multiple places:
1. **Quick reference**: `requirements.txt` comments
2. **Detailed guide**: `GPU_SETUP.md`
3. **Conda users**: `conda-recipe/README.md` and `environment.yml`
4. **Pip users**: `requirements_gpu.txt`
5. **Automated**: `install_cuml.sh` script

## 📦 Installation Methods

Users can now install GPU dependencies via:

### Method 1: Automated (Easiest)
```bash
./install_cuml.sh
```

### Method 2: Using requirements_gpu.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements_gpu.txt
```

### Method 3: Using conda (Recommended)
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge cupy
conda install -c rapidsai -c conda-forge -c nvidia cuml
```

### Method 4: Using pyproject.toml extras
```bash
pip install cupy-cuda12x  # Choose your CUDA version
pip install .[gpu-full]
```

## 🔍 Dependencies Status

| Dependency | Type | Installation | Status |
|------------|------|--------------|--------|
| **numpy** | Required | Automatic | ✅ Always installed |
| **scikit-learn** | Required | Automatic | ✅ Always installed |
| **cupy** | Optional | Manual | ⚠️ User must install for GPU |
| **cuml** | Optional | Manual | ⚠️ User must install for full GPU |

## 💡 Key Points

1. **GPU dependencies are OPTIONAL** - The package works fine without them (CPU fallback)
2. **Clear warnings** - Users know when GPU libraries are missing
3. **Multiple installation paths** - Users can choose what works for their setup
4. **Performance documented** - Users know what speedup to expect
5. **Troubleshooting included** - Common issues are addressed

## 📚 Next Steps for Users

When users see the warnings, they should:

1. Read `GPU_SETUP.md` for comprehensive guidance
2. Choose installation method based on their setup
3. Install CuPy for 6-8x speedup (easiest)
4. Optionally install RAPIDS cuML for 12-20x speedup (best performance)

## ✨ Summary

All configuration files now properly document GPU dependencies as optional packages that users can install for significant performance improvements. The warnings are intentional - they inform users of available optimizations without blocking CPU-only usage.
