# Quick Fix: GPU Bottleneck in Neighbor Queries

**Problem**: Processing 18.6M points was slow - split into 4 batches of 5M when it should be 1 batch  
**Solution**: Fixed hardcoded batch size override and increased GPU thresholds  
**Expected Speedup**: 3-4Ã— faster neighbor queries, 1.5-2Ã— faster overall processing

## What Was Changed

### File: `ign_lidar/features/features_gpu_chunked.py`

#### 1. Smart Memory-Based Batching (Lines 2745-2769)

**Before**: Hardcoded 5M batch size ignored user config  
**After**: Calculates actual memory needs, respects user's `neighbor_query_batch_size`

#### 2. Increased GPU Thresholds (Lines 251-267)

**Before**: RTX 4080 Super limited to 5M points  
**After**: RTX 4080 Super can handle 25M points (5Ã— increase)

#### 3. Reduced Logging Overhead (Lines 2805-2812)

**Before**: Logged every 5 batches  
**After**: Logs every 10 batches + milestones

## How to Test

Run your existing command:

```bash
ign-lidar-hd process \
  -c "ign_lidar/configs/presets/asprs_rtx4080.yaml" \
  input_dir="/mnt/d/ign/selected_tiles/asprs/tiles" \
  output_dir="/mnt/d/ign/preprocessed_ground_truth"
```

### Expected Log Output (NEW âœ…)

```
ðŸ“Š Neighbor query memory: 2.98GB (safe for single query!)
ðŸš€ Querying 18,651,688 neighbors in ONE operation (optimized!)
âœ“ GPU neighbor query complete (18,651,688 Ã— 20 neighbors)
```

### Old Log Output (Before Fix)

```
ðŸš€ Querying 18,651,688 neighbors in 4 batches (prevents GPU hang)...
   Batch size: 5,000,000 points per batch
   Progress: 1/4 batches (25%)
   Progress: 2/4 batches (50%)
   ...
```

## Key Improvements

1. âœ… Your `neighbor_query_batch_size: 30000000` config is now **respected**
2. âœ… RTX 4080 Super threshold increased from 5M â†’ **25M points**
3. âœ… Batching only happens when memory requirements exceed **50% VRAM**
4. âœ… Less GPU synchronization overhead from logging

---

## Memory Safety

For 18.6M points with k=20 neighbors:

```
Required memory: 18.6M Ã— 20 Ã— 8 bytes = 2.98GB
Available VRAM: 14.7GB (RTX 4080 Super)
Usage: 2.98GB / 14.7GB = 20% (SAFE! âœ…)
```

The new logic checks actual memory needs before forcing batching, unlike the old hardcoded threshold.
