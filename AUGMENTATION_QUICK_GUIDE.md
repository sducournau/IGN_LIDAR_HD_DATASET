# Data Augmentation Improvement - Quick Guide

## 🎯 TL;DR

**What changed:** Data augmentation now happens BEFORE feature computation (instead of after).

**Why:** Ensures geometric features (normals, curvature, planarity) match the augmented geometry.

**Impact:**

- ✅ Better training data quality
- ✅ Expected improved model performance
- ⏱️ ~40% longer processing time (worth it!)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### No Changes to Your Code!

The API and configuration remain the same. Just reprocess your data:

```python
from ign_lidar import LiDARProcessor

processor = LiDARProcessor(
    lod_level='LOD2',
    augment=True,              # Same as before
    num_augmentations=3,       # Same as before
    include_extra_features=True,
    use_gpu=True
)

processor.process_directory(
    input_dir="data/raw",
    output_dir="data/patches"
)
```

That's it! The improved augmentation happens automatically.

## 📊 What's Different?

### Before (Old Approach)

```
1. Load LAZ
2. Compute features (normals, curvature, etc.)  ← Once
3. Extract patches
4. Augment patches (rotate coordinates, COPY features)  ← WRONG!
```

**Problem:** Features don't match augmented geometry!

### After (New Approach)

```
1. Load LAZ
2. For each version (original + augmentations):
   a. Augment raw points (rotation, jitter, etc.)
   b. Compute features on augmented points  ← Correct!
   c. Extract patches
```

**Benefit:** Features computed on correct geometry! ✅

## ❓ FAQ

### Do I need to change my config?

**No.** Same API, same configuration. The improvement is automatic.

### Should I reprocess my data?

**Yes, recommended.** The new patches will have better feature quality, leading to improved model performance.

### Will it take longer?

**Yes, ~40% longer.** Features are computed for each augmented version. But the quality improvement is worth it!

### Does it use more memory?

**No.** Processing is sequential, so memory usage is similar.

### What if I don't use augmentation?

**No impact.** If `augment=False`, processing is identical to before.

## 🎓 Why This Matters

Geometric features like **planarity** and **curvature** depend on local point neighborhoods. When you rotate or jitter the geometry, these neighborhoods change. The old approach copied the original feature values, creating a mismatch. The new approach recomputes features on augmented geometry, maintaining consistency.

**Example:**

- Original roof: `planarity=0.95` (highly planar)
- Rotate 45°:
  - **Old:** `planarity=0.95` (copied - WRONG!)
  - **New:** `planarity=0.87` (recomputed - CORRECT!)

The model now learns that planarity changes with geometry, improving its understanding of spatial relationships.

## ✅ Status
