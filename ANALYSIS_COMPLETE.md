## 📈 Impact Assessment

### What's Working Well

✅ **Strong Foundation (78% translated)**

- Release notes: 100% complete
- Tutorials: 100% complete
- Core guides: 85% complete
- Feature docs: 86% complete

✅ **Proper i18n Configuration**

- Docusaurus properly configured for EN/FR
- Directory structure follows best practices

### What Needs Attention

❌ **GPU Documentation** (0% translated)

- Critical for users with GPU hardware
- 3 files need complete translation

❌ **User Onboarding** (Partial)

- Getting started guide still in English
- GPU setup guide not translated
- These are first touchpoints for new users

⚠️ **API Documentation** (50% coverage)

- CLI reference needs translation
- GPU API not translated
- Configuration API partially complete

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Translation Challenges Identified

1. **File Existence ≠ Translation**

   - Many French files exist but contain English content
   - Need content-based detection, not just file presence

2. **Translation Notices Present**

   - Several files have "needs translation" markers
   - Indicates awareness but incomplete follow-through

3. **GPU Documentation Gap**
   - New feature area not yet translated
   - Shows translation backlog for recent additions

### Best Practices Established

1. **Automated Checking**

   - Scripts can detect true translation status
   - Prevents false sense of completion

2. **Priority Framework**

   - User-facing docs should be prioritized
   - Technical API docs can follow

3. **Consistent Structure**
   - Mirror EN/FR directory structures
   - Maintain parallel organization
