**Implementation Date:** January 2025  
**Version:** 3.3.0  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview

Phase 2.3 implements horizontal protrusion detection for advanced building classification. This feature identifies balconies, overhangs, and canopies protruding from building facades, enabling more detailed LOD3 architectural representation.

## Implemented Features

### Core Functionality

✅ **BalconyDetector Class** (`ign_lidar/core/classification/building/balcony_detector.py`)

- Facade line extraction from building polygons
- Horizontal distance computation from facades
- Multi-criteria candidate point filtering
- DBSCAN-based spatial clustering
- Geometric classification (balcony/overhang/canopy)
- Confidence scoring system

✅ **Protrusion Type Classification**

- **BALCONY:** Residential balconies, terraces (2-15m height, 0.8-3m depth, 2-20m² area)
- **OVERHANG:** Roof overhangs, eaves (>8m height, <1.5m depth, horizontal)
- **CANOPY:** Entry canopies, porches (2-8m height, <2m depth, >3m² area)

## Algorithm Details

### 1. Facade Line Extraction

```python
facade_lines = detector._extract_facade_lines(building_polygon)
```

- Extracts facade segments from building footprint polygon
- Converts each polygon edge to Shapely LineString
- Supports complex building geometries (L-shaped, U-shaped)

### 2. Distance Computation

```python
distances, facade_indices = detector._compute_distance_from_facades(points, facade_lines)
```

- Computes horizontal distance from each point to nearest facade
- Tracks which facade each point is closest to
- Uses Shapely's efficient distance calculations

### 3. Candidate Filtering

Multi-criteria filtering identifies potential protrusion points:

```python
candidate_mask = (
    distances > min_distance_from_facade &  # Beyond facade
    distances < max_balcony_depth &         # Within reasonable depth
    heights > min_height_above_ground &     # Above ground
    verticality < 0.7 &                     # Horizontal or railing
    z < roof_elevation - threshold          # Below roof
)
```

### 4. DBSCAN Clustering

```python
clustering = DBSCAN(eps=dbscan_eps, min_samples=dbscan_min_samples)
labels = clustering.fit_predict(candidate_points[:, :3])
```

- Groups spatially nearby protrusion points
- Separates distinct features (e.g., balconies on different sides)
- Filters noise points (label = -1)

### 5. Geometric Classification

**Balcony Detection:**

```python
if (2.0 <= avg_height <= 15.0 and
    0.8 <= depth <= 3.0 and
    2.0 <= area <= 20.0 and
    0.2 <= avg_verticality <= 0.6):
    type = BALCONY
    confidence = (height_score + depth_score + area_score) / 3
```

**Overhang Detection:**

```python
elif (avg_height > 8.0 and
      depth < 1.5 and
      avg_verticality < 0.3):
    type = OVERHANG
    confidence = (1.0 - depth/1.5) * (1.0 - avg_verticality/0.3)
```

**Canopy Detection:**

```python
elif (2.0 <= avg_height <= 8.0 and
      depth < 2.0 and
      area > 3.0 and
      avg_verticality < 0.4):
    type = CANOPY
    confidence = (area_score + (1.0 - avg_verticality/0.4)) / 2
```

### 6. Confidence Scoring

- **Height consistency:** How well height matches expected range
- **Depth consistency:** Protrusion depth within expected bounds
- **Area consistency:** Surface area appropriate for feature type
- **Verticality consistency:** Horizontal vs. vertical alignment
- **Overall confidence:** Weighted average of individual scores

## Integration Points

### Main Processing Pipeline

```python
from ign_lidar.core.classification.building.balcony_detector import BalconyDetector

detector = BalconyDetector(
    min_distance_from_facade=0.5,
    min_balcony_points=25,
    max_balcony_depth=3.0
)

result = detector.detect_protrusions(
    points=building_points,
    features=computed_features,
    building_polygon=polygon,
    ground_elevation=elevation
)

# Access results
for protrusion in result.protrusions:
    print(f"Type: {protrusion.type.name}")
    print(f"Confidence: {protrusion.confidence:.2f}")
    print(f"Depth: {protrusion.depth:.2f}m")
    print(f"Area: {protrusion.area:.2f}m²")
```

### Feature Enrichment

Detected balconies add metadata to point clouds:

- **Balcony flag:** Boolean indicator
- **Protrusion type:** Enum (BALCONY, OVERHANG, CANOPY, UNKNOWN)
- **Confidence score:** Float 0.0-1.0
- **Facade side:** Integer index of associated facade

### Classification Schema Integration

```python
# Point cloud attributes
point_data = {
    'has_balcony': bool,
    'protrusion_type': int,  # 0=none, 1=balcony, 2=overhang, 3=canopy
    'protrusion_confidence': float,
    'facade_side': int
}
```

## Configuration Guidelines

### Parameter Tuning by Building Type

**Residential Buildings (Standard Balconies)**

```yaml
min_distance_from_facade: 0.5
max_balcony_depth: 2.5
min_balcony_points: 25
dbscan_eps: 0.5
```

**High-Density Urban (Smaller Features)**

```yaml
min_distance_from_facade: 0.4
max_balcony_depth: 2.0
min_balcony_points: 20
dbscan_eps: 0.4
```

**Large Terraces/Verandas**

```yaml
min_distance_from_facade: 0.6
max_balcony_depth: 5.0
min_balcony_points: 40
dbscan_eps: 0.8
```

**Historic Buildings (Complex Overhangs)**

```yaml
min_distance_from_facade: 0.3
max_balcony_depth: 3.0
min_height_above_ground: 1.5
confidence_threshold: 0.4
```

### Common Troubleshooting

**Issue:** No balconies detected despite visual confirmation

- **Solution:** Lower `min_distance_from_facade` (0.3-0.4m) or reduce `min_balcony_points` (15-20)

**Issue:** Too many false positives (facade irregularities)

- **Solution:** Increase `confidence_threshold` (0.6-0.7) or `min_balcony_points` (30-40)

**Issue:** Balconies merged with nearby features

- **Solution:** Reduce `dbscan_eps` (0.3-0.4m) for stricter clustering

**Issue:** Large terraces not detected

- **Solution:** Increase `max_balcony_depth` (4.0-5.0m) and `min_balcony_points` (40-50)

**Issue:** Ground-level patios detected as balconies

- **Solution:** Increase `min_height_above_ground` (2.5-3.0m)

## Known Limitations

### Current Constraints

1. **Facade Simplification:** Uses building polygon for facade detection; doesn't account for facade irregularities
2. **Vertical Resolution:** Performance depends on LiDAR point density (0.5-1 pt/m² minimum)
3. **Enclosed Balconies:** May miss fully enclosed (glazed) balconies
4. **Vegetation Occlusion:** Trees/plants can occlude balconies
5. **Complex Geometries:** Multi-level balconies may be merged if too close

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] 3D facade detection using wall segmentation
- [ ] Multi-level balcony separation
- [ ] Integration with RGB data for material classification
- [ ] Railing detection for improved confidence
- [ ] Overhang vs. balcony distinction refinement
- [ ] GPU-accelerated distance computation
