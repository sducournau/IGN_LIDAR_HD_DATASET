    original_data = self._load_tile(laz_file, tile_data)
    
    # 2. Compute features (via FeatureOrchestrator)
    all_features, points, classification = self._compute_features(...)
    
    # 3. Apply classification (ASPRS→LOD + ground truth)
    labels = self._apply_classification(...)
    
    # 4. Extract patches (if enabled)
    if self.save_patches:
        patches = self._extract_patches(...)
        
        # 5a. Save patches (multi-format)
        num_patches = self.output_writer.save_patches(...)
    
    # 5b. Save enriched LAZ (if enabled)
    if self.output_writer.should_save_enriched_laz:
        self.output_writer.save_enriched_laz(...)
    
    # 6. Save metadata
    self.output_writer.save_metadata(...)
```

## 🎓 Architecture Evolution

### Before: Monolithic God Class

```
LiDARProcessor (3,082 lines)
├── __init__() (487 lines) - Everything initialization
├── _process_tile_core() (1,320 lines) - Everything processing
│   ├── Load tile
│   ├── Compute features
│   ├── Apply classification
│   ├── Extract patches
│   └── Save outputs
└── 50+ other methods scattered throughout
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ God class anti-pattern
- ❌ Impossible to test individual pieces
- ❌ Hard to understand workflow
- ❌ Difficult to modify without breaking things
- ❌ No clear separation of concerns

### After: Modular Component Architecture

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Extremely Well

1. **Incremental Extraction Approach**
   - Created one component at a time
   - Committed after each component
   - Fixed issues immediately before moving on

2. **Documentation First**
   - Created detailed plans before implementing
   - Kept progress tracker updated throughout
   - Made intentions clear in commit messages

3. **Clear Responsibilities**
   - Each component has one clear purpose
   - No overlap between components
   - Easy to understand what goes where

4. **Immediate Fixes**
   - Fixed API compatibility issues immediately
   - Ran lint checks after each creation
   - Didn't accumulate technical debt

### Challenges Overcome

1. **API Compatibility**
   - **Challenge:** PatchExtractor used wrong function signatures
   - **Solution:** Read actual function signatures and fixed parameters
   - **Lesson:** Always verify API before creating wrappers

2. **Attribute Name Collisions**
   - **Challenge:** OutputWriter attributes collided with method names
   - **Solution:** Renamed attributes (e.g., `should_save_enriched_laz`)
   - **Lesson:** Check for name collisions before committing

3. **Import Path Issues**
   - **Challenge:** Needed to load LAZ files but path was unclear
   - **Solution:** Used laspy directly with inline import
   - **Lesson:** Keep fallback implementations simple

### Best Practices Established

1. **Component Creation Pattern:**
   - Extract responsibility clearly
   - Create class with focused interface
   - Document thoroughly
   - Fix lint errors immediately
   - Commit with detailed message

2. **Orchestration Pattern:**
   - Create coordinator last (TileProcessor)
   - Coordinate all components in one place
   - Keep workflow simple and readable
   - Delegate everything to components

3. **Progress Tracking:**
   - Update progress tracker after each component
   - Celebrate milestones
   - Keep metrics visible

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Phase 2.5: LiDARProcessor Facade Refactoring

**Goal:** Transform LiDARProcessor into facade pattern

**Tasks:**
1. ✅ All components created (Phase 2.1-2.4)
2. ⏳ Update `LiDARProcessor.__init__()` to use ProcessorCore
3. ⏳ Replace `_process_tile_core()` with TileProcessor delegation
4. ⏳ Update `process_directory()` to instantiate TileProcessor
5. ⏳ Remove direct processing logic (~1,500 lines)

7. ⏳ Maintain backward compatibility

**Expected Outcome:**
- `processor.py`: 3,082 lines → ~500 lines (84% reduction!)
- Clean facade pattern
- All processing delegated to components
- Backward compatible

### Testing & Validation

1. ⏳ **Integration Testing**
   - Test full pipeline with all components
   - Verify output correctness
   - Check backward compatibility

2. ⏳ **Performance Benchmarking**
   - Compare with pre-refactoring baseline
   - Ensure no regression
   - Measure memory usage

3. ⏳ **Documentation Updates**
   - Architecture diagrams with new components
   - API documentation for new classes
   - Migration guide for users
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
