## 🔍 Analysis Results

### Size Comparison Review

The two files flagged with size differences were reviewed:

1. **guides/features/overview.md** (11% difference)

   - ✅ Verified: French is naturally more verbose
   - ✅ Content is properly aligned
   - ✅ No missing sections

2. **reference/cli-patch.md** (10% difference)
   - ✅ Verified: Translation expansion is normal
   - ✅ Structure matches English version
   - ✅ Technical accuracy maintained

**Conclusion:** Size differences are due to natural French language verbosity, not missing content.

## 📝 Translation Maintenance Guide

### For Future Updates

When updating English documentation:

```bash
# 1. Edit English file
vim website/docs/path/to/file.md

# 2. Update corresponding French file
vim website/i18n/fr/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/path/to/file.md

# 3. Verify build
cd website && npm run build

# 4. Test both locales
npm run start          # English
npm run start -- --locale fr  # French

# 5. Commit both files together
git add website/docs/path/to/file.md
git add website/i18n/fr/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/path/to/file.md
git commit -m "docs: update documentation (EN/FR)"
```

### Translation Checklist

- ✅ Translate titles and descriptions
- ✅ Translate body text
- ✅ Preserve code blocks (do not translate)
- ✅ Preserve command names
- ✅ Preserve file paths
- ✅ Keep URLs unchanged
- ✅ Maintain document structure
- ✅ Test build before committing

## 🛠️ Available Tools
