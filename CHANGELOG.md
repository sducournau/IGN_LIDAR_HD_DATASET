### 🔧 Critical Fix: Ground Truth Data Fetcher

This release fixes critical issues with BD TOPO® ground truth classification that prevented points from being classified to roads, cemeteries, power lines, and other infrastructure features.

**Impact:** Ground truth classification from IGN BD TOPO® now works correctly for all configured features.

---

### Fixed

#### Ground Truth Fetcher Integration (`ign_lidar/core/processor.py`)

**Issue:** Ground truth classification was not being applied due to incorrect class imports and missing parameters.

**Root Causes:**

1. Processor imported non-existent `MultiSourceDataFetcher` class (should be `DataFetcher`)
2. Missing BD TOPO feature parameters (cemeteries, power_lines, sports) not passed to fetcher
3. Missing buffer parameters (road_width_fallback, railway_width_fallback, power_line_buffer)
4. Incorrect method call (`fetch_data()` instead of `fetch_all()`)

**Fixes:**

- ✅ Changed import from `MultiSourceDataFetcher` to `DataFetcher` and `DataFetchConfig`
- ✅ Added ALL BD TOPO features to fetcher initialization (lines 220-251)
- ✅ Added missing parameters: `include_cemeteries`, `include_power_lines`, `include_sports`
- ✅ Added buffer parameters: `road_width_fallback`, `railway_width_fallback`, `power_line_buffer`
- ✅ Fixed method call from `fetch_data()` to `fetch_all()` (line 1010)
- ✅ Enhanced logging to show all enabled BD TOPO features

**Result:** Points are now correctly classified to:

- ASPRS 11: Road Surface ✅
- ASPRS 40: Parking ✅
- ASPRS 41: Sports Facilities ✅
- ASPRS 42: Cemeteries ✅
- ASPRS 43: Power Lines ✅

---

### Added

```

#### Pipeline Configuration Example

```yaml
global:
  num_workers: 4

enrich:
  input_dir: "data/raw"
  output: "data/enriched"
  add_rgb: true
  rgb_cache_dir: "cache/"

ign-lidar-hd process --input tiles/ --output patches/

# New (recommended)
ign-lidar-hd patch --input tiles/ --output patches/
```

#### RGB Augmentation (Opt-in)

```bash
# Without RGB (default, backwards compatible)
ign-lidar-hd enrich --input-dir raw/ --output enriched/

# With RGB (new feature, opt-in)
ign-lidar-hd enrich --input-dir raw/ --output enriched/ \
  --add-rgb --rgb-cache-dir cache/
```

### Backwards Compatibility

- All existing code continues to work without modifications
- RGB augmentation is opt-in via `--add-rgb` flag
- Default behavior unchanged (no RGB)
- `process` command still functional (with deprecation notice)
- No breaking changes to Python API

### Known Issues

#### GPU Acceleration Non-Functional

The `--use-gpu` flag is currently **non-functional** in v1.2.0:

- GPU module exists (`features_gpu.py`) but is not integrated with CLI/Processor
- Flag is parsed but silently falls back to CPU processing
- No functional impact (CPU processing works correctly)
- Will be properly integrated in v1.3.0

**Workaround:** None needed - CPU processing is fully functional and optimized.

See `GPU_ANALYSIS.md` for detailed technical analysis.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-03

### 🎯 Major Improvements - QGIS Compatibility & Geometric Features

This release fixes critical issues with QGIS compatibility and geometric feature calculation, eliminating scan line artifacts and ensuring enriched LAZ files can be visualized in QGIS.

### Added

- **QGIS Compatibility Script** (`scripts/validation/simplify_for_qgis.py`)

  - Converts LAZ 1.4 format 6 files to LAZ 1.2 format 3 for QGIS compatibility
  - Preserves 3 key dimensions: height, planar, vertical
  - Remaps classification values to 0-31 range (format 3 limit)
  - Reduces file size by ~73% while maintaining essential geometric features

- **Radius-Based Geometric Features** (`ign_lidar/features.py`)

  - New `estimate_optimal_radius_for_features()` function for adaptive radius calculation
  - Auto-calculates optimal search radius (15-20x average nearest neighbor distance)
  - Eliminates scan line artifacts in linearity/planarity attributes
  - Typical radius: 0.75-1.5m for IGN LIDAR HD data

- **Diagnostic Tools**

  - `scripts/validation/diagnostic_qgis.py` - Comprehensive LAZ file validation for QGIS
  - `scripts/validation/test_radius_vs_k.py` - Comparison of k-neighbors vs radius-based features

- **Documentation**
  - `SOLUTION_FINALE_QGIS.md` - Complete guide for QGIS compatibility
  - `docs/QGIS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Troubleshooting guide with 6 solution categories
  - `docs/RADIUS_BASED_FEATURES_FIX.md` - Technical explanation of radius-based approach
  - `docs/LASPY_BACKEND_ERROR_FIX.md` - Backend compatibility documentation

### Fixed

- **Geometric Feature Artifacts**

  - Replaced k-neighbors (k=50) with radius-based neighborhood search
  - Fixed "dash lines" (lignes pointillées) appearing in linearity/planarity attributes
  - Corrected geometric formulas: normalized by eigenvalue sum instead of λ₀
  - Formula corrections:
    - Linearity: `(λ₀ - λ₁) / (λ₀ + λ₁ + λ₂)` (was: `/ λ₀`)
    - Planarity: `(λ₁ - λ₂) / (λ₀ + λ₁ + λ₂)` (was: `/ λ₀`)
    - Sphericity: `λ₂ / (λ₀ + λ₁ + λ₂)` (was: `/ λ₀`)

- **LAZ Compression Issues**

  - Added `do_compress=True` parameter to all `.write()` calls
  - Ensures proper LAZ compression in enriched output files

- **Laspy Backend Compatibility**

  - Removed `laz_backend='laszip'` parameter (incompatible with laspy 2.6.1+)
  - Let laspy auto-detect available backend (lazrs/laszip)
  - Fixed `'str' object has no attribute 'is_available'` error

- **QGIS File Reading**
  - Files are now readable in QGIS via simplified format conversion
  - Addressed limitation: QGIS has poor support for LAZ 1.4 format 6 with extra dimensions
  - Solution: Convert to LAZ 1.2 format 3 while preserving key attributes

### Changed

- **Geometric Feature Calculation** (`ign_lidar/features.py`)

  - `extract_geometric_features()` now uses `query_radius()` instead of `query(k)`
  - Default behavior: auto-calculate radius if not provided
  - Maintains backward compatibility with `k` parameter
  - Performance: slightly slower but produces artifact-free results

- **CLI Enrichment** (`ign_lidar/cli.py`)
  - Removed problematic `laz_backend` parameter from write operations
  - Improved LAZ compression reliability

### Performance

- **File Size Reduction**: Simplified QGIS files are ~73% smaller (192 MB → 51 MB typical)
- **Feature Calculation**: Radius-based search is ~10-15% slower but eliminates artifacts
- **Memory**: No significant change in memory usage

### Technical Details

#### Radius Calculation

```python
# Auto-calculated from average nearest neighbor distance
radius = 15-20 × avg_nn_distance
# Typical for IGN LIDAR HD: 0.75-1.5m
```

#### QGIS Compatible Format

- **Input**: LAZ 1.4, point format 6, 15 extra dimensions
- **Output**: LAZ 1.2, point format 3, 3 key dimensions
- **Preserved dimensions**: height_above_ground, planarity, verticality

#### References

- Weinmann et al. (2015) - Semantic point cloud interpretation
- Demantké et al. (2011) - Dimensionality based scale selection

### Migration Guide

#### For existing users

1. **Update package**: `pip install --upgrade ign-lidar-hd`

2. **Re-enrich files** (recommended): Previous enriched files may have scan artifacts

   ```bash
   ign-lidar enrich your_file.laz
   ```

3. **For QGIS visualization**: Convert existing enriched files

   ```bash
   python scripts/validation/simplify_for_qgis.py enriched_file.laz
   ```

4. **Batch conversion**: Convert all enriched files for QGIS
   ```bash
   find /path/to/files/ -name "*.laz" ! -name "*_qgis.laz" -exec python scripts/validation/simplify_for_qgis.py {} \;
   ```

### Known Issues

- QGIS versions < 3.18 may not support point cloud visualization
- Full 15-dimension files require CloudCompare or PDAL for visualization
- Classification values > 31 are clipped in format 3 conversion

### Dependencies

- laspy >= 2.6.1 (with lazrs backend)
- numpy >= 1.21.0
- scikit-learn >= 1.0.0
