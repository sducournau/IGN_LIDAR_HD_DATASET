        """Intelligent road-vegetation separation using height + NDVI"""

        # Find points classified as both road and vegetation
        road_mask = (labels == self.ASPRS_ROAD)
        veg_mask = (labels == self.ASPRS_MEDIUM_VEGETATION)

        # Apply intelligent rules:
        # 1. Height separation: roads are typically lower
        # 2. NDVI correlation: vegetation has higher NDVI
        # 3. Spatial clustering: roads form linear features

        conflict_points = road_mask & veg_mask
        if np.any(conflict_points):
            # Rule 1: Height-based decision
            low_points = height[conflict_points] < 0.5
            high_ndvi = ndvi[conflict_points] > 0.4

            # Vegetation wins if: high NDVI AND elevated
            veg_decision = high_ndvi & (~low_points)
            road_decision = ~veg_decision

            # Apply decisions

def apply_building_buffer_rules(self, labels, points, buildings_gdf, height):
    """Classify unclassified points near buildings using intelligent buffer zones"""

    # Create adaptive buffers around buildings
    for _, building in buildings_gdf.iterrows():
        building_height = building.get('hauteur', 10.0)  # Default 10m

        # Intelligent buffer sizing based on building height
        buffer_distance = min(building_height * 0.3, 5.0)  # 30% of height, max 5m
        building_buffer = building.geometry.buffer(buffer_distance)

        # Find unclassified points in buffer
        unclassified_mask = (labels == self.ASPRS_UNCLASSIFIED)
        buffer_candidates = # ... spatial query ...

        low_confidence_mask = confidence < 0.3
        labels = self._validate_low_confidence(labels, low_confidence_mask, features)

        # Stage 5: Hierarchical level mapping (ASPRS → LOD2 → LOD3)
        target_labels = self._map_to_target_level(labels, self.target_level)
