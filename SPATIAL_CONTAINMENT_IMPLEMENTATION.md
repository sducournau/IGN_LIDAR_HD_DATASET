# Spatial Containment Implementation Summary

**Date:** January 2025  
**Task:** Implement BD TOPO Spatial Containment Checks  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Overview

Implemented efficient spatial containment checks in the ASPRS Class Rules Engine to leverage BD TOPO (French national geospatial database) ground truth data for improved classification accuracy.

## Implementation Details

### New Method: `_check_spatial_containment()`

**Location:** `ign_lidar/core/classification/asprs_class_rules.py` (lines 145-237)

**Purpose:** Check if LiDAR points are spatially contained within ground truth polygons with optional buffer zones.

**Key Features:**

- **STRtree Spatial Indexing:** Uses shapely's STRtree for O(log n) spatial queries when dealing with multiple polygons (>10)
- **Buffer Support:** Allows positive buffer (expansion) or negative buffer (inset) for flexible containment rules
- **Graceful Degradation:** Falls back to linear polygon iteration for small polygon sets
- **Error Handling:** Returns unchanged mask if shapely/geopandas unavailable

**Signature:**

```python
def _check_spatial_containment(
    self,
    points: np.ndarray,           # [N, 3] XYZ coordinates
    mask: np.ndarray,              # [N] boolean candidate mask
    polygons: Any,                 # GeoDataFrame or list of geometries
    buffer_m: float = 0.0,         # Buffer distance in meters
    use_strtree: bool = True       # Enable STRtree optimization
) -> np.ndarray:                   # [N] refined boolean mask
```

## Updated Classification Methods

### 1. Water Body Detection (Line 338-348)

**Before:** TODO comment, no spatial filtering  
**After:** Refines water candidates using BD TOPO water polygons with 2m buffer for edge tolerance

```python
water_mask = self._check_spatial_containment(
    points, water_mask, water_polygons,
    buffer_m=2.0  # Small buffer for edge tolerance
)
```

### 2. Bridge Detection - Road Alignment (Line 416-426)

**Before:** TODO comment, no road proximity check  
**After:** Filters elevated points to those near/aligned with roads using 10m buffer

```python
bridge_mask = self._check_spatial_containment(
    points, bridge_mask, roads,
    buffer_m=10.0  # 10m buffer for road alignment
)
```

### 3. Bridge Detection - Water Proximity (Line 429-437)

**Before:** TODO comment, no water proximity check  
**After:** Checks if elevated bridge candidates are near water bodies using 25m buffer

```python
bridge_mask = self._check_spatial_containment(
    points, bridge_mask, water,
    buffer_m=25.0  # 25m buffer for water proximity
)
```

### 4. Railway Detection (Line 516-526)

**Before:** TODO comment, no railway alignment check  
**After:** Assigns points within 5m buffer of BD TOPO railway lines

```python
railway_mask = self._check_spatial_containment(
    points, railway_mask, railways,
    buffer_m=5.0  # 5m buffer for railway alignment
)
```

## Performance Characteristics

| Polygon Count | Method           | Complexity   |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| ≤10           | Linear iteration | O(n × m)     |
| >10           | STRtree indexing | O(n × log m) |

Where:

- **n** = number of candidate points
- **m** = number of polygons

## Test Coverage

**New Test File:** `tests/test_spatial_containment.py`

✅ **6/6 tests passing:**

1. `test_basic_containment` - Point-in-polygon verification
2. `test_buffer_expansion` - Buffer distance handling
3. `test_strtree_optimization` - STRtree usage with multiple polygons
4. `test_mask_filtering` - Input mask filtering behavior
5. `test_empty_polygons` - Empty polygon list handling
6. `test_no_candidates` - Zero candidate points handling

## Dependencies

**Required:**

- `shapely >= 2.0.0` - Polygon geometry operations
- `geopandas >= 0.12.0` - GeoDataFrame handling

**Fallback Behavior:**
If dependencies unavailable, logs warning and returns unmodified mask (no spatial filtering).

## Impact & Benefits

### Accuracy Improvements

- **Water Classification:** Eliminates false positives by constraining to known water bodies
- **Bridge Detection:** Reduces false positives by verifying road alignment and water proximity
- **Railway Classification:** Ensures detected tracks align with known railway infrastructure

### Processing Efficiency

- **O(log n) lookups** via STRtree for large ground truth datasets
- **Selective checking:** Only processes candidate points (those passing initial geometric/spectral filters)
- **Memory efficient:** Returns refined mask without creating new point arrays

### Data Quality

- **BD TOPO Integration:** Leverages authoritative French national geospatial database
- **Configurable buffers:** Flexible tolerance zones for each classification type
- **Graceful degradation:** Works without ground truth data (optional enhancement)

## Known Limitations

1. **Existing Test Failures:** Pre-existing ASPRS test failures unrelated to spatial containment (missing enum values, shape mismatches)
2. **Lambert 93 CRS:** Currently hardcoded to EPSG:2154 (French projection)
3. **XY-only:** Uses 2D containment (Z-axis ignored for spatial queries)

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Configurable CRS per region
- [ ] 3D volumetric containment for complex structures
- [ ] Caching of STRtree indices across tiles
- [ ] Parallel spatial queries for multi-core processing
